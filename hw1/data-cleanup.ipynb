Images of sea surface temperature will be generated and will be accessible on the ship to support field studies requiring real- time satellite coverage. After post-cruise quality control, the images will be published on CD-ROMs for distribution to all JGOFS investigators. A domain extending from 12.5oS to 12.5oN and 130oW to 145oW will be covered. Processes that can be observed in this domain include the upwelling tongue along the equator and the Intertropical Convergence Zone at 8oN. The data will be used for statistical studies of the formation, evolution and decay of surface temperature patterns, as well as for process-oriented studies for which simultaneous shipboard sampling is available.&apos;,\n",

       "  &quot;The Mathematics Improvement Project (MIP) represents a  concentrated effort to increase the numbers of underrepresented  students majoring in science, mathematics, or engineering at  the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) by focusing on  their successful completion of College Algebra and Pre-  calculus. The project is incorporating programmatic structures  that facilitate faculty training, curricular design, and  implementation of pedagogical practices designed to both meet  the special needs of underrepresented students and to promote  critical thinking and mastery of mathematical concepts. Four  faculty within the Division of Mathematics, Computer Science,  and Statistics (MCSS) at UTSA are working as MIP faculty and  are designing and implementing a culture-sensitive learning  environment as well as a non-traditional instructional  curriculum to insure that students are prepared to work in the  global community in the 21st century. Although the program is  open to all students, underrepresented students enrolling in  College Algebra and Pre-calculus are being targeted. Through  collaboration with the university&apos;s Student Services offices  and by formalizing ties with local schools and community  colleges, this program is implementing an effective system of  recruitment, retention, and successful completion of the MIP  mathematics sequence for underrepresented students. MIP&apos;s  pipeline is generating a new momentum which allows students to  build confidence and to achieve an incremental gain in skills  powerful enough to ensure success in future mathematics  courses. The overall goal is to increase the rate of  undergraduate students successfully completing the math  sequence by at least 20%.***//&quot;,\n",

Most undergraduates at Rutgers are first generation college  students and 30 percent are minorities. Many are underprepared  to succeed in the sciences. Our proposed project is to create  a physics course specifically for underprepared science and  pre-health profession majors that is rigorous, laboratory  based, and non-threatening. Based on our experience with a  somewhat similar course for engineering students and the  research findings and developments of others, we are designing  a program with active lectures, cooperative learning, and  qualitative and quantitative laboratories that will help our  students succeed in science and pre-health profession majors  and be exportable to other colleges and universities  schools.***//&apos;,\n",

Project activities will span 3 years with 5  weeks of course work for leaders each summer and extensive  implementation and follow up activities during the school  year. The LITES (lead teachers) will be trained in the use  of several validated activity-based science curricula, will  select course options to improve their science knowledge,  and will learn leadership skills to assist other teachers in  implementing activity-based science. School teams will be  comprised of an administrator, primary, and intermediate  teacher. Schools with significant populations of minority  students will be given priority.   This leadership proposal is appropriate for teacher  enhancement because it is designed to enhance the science  knowledge and teaching, and develop leadership skills of  teams of teachers from participating schools, and because it  targets teachers of a needy population.   Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 39% of the amount  requested from NSF.&apos;,\n",

       "  &quot;This proposal seeks support to develop and implement a two-  semester course of instruction designed to provide an  integrated introduction to science for pre-service elementary  education (first through eighth grade) majors. Concurrent with  an inquiry-centered laboratory-based content course is the  development of a practicum in which the pre-service students  will work with master teacher/mentors teachers to translate  science content into actual learning situations with children.  This practicum will involve teachers and students from the  Moscow, Idaho Public Schools and the Couer d&apos;Alene Reservation  Schools. Additional school districts will be brought into  participation as the project matures. At the end of three  years, all elementary education majors will participate in this  program. The curriculum will be developed by six research  faculty from the departments of chemistry, biology, physics,  geology, and biochemistry, in collaboration with science  education specialists as well as teachers and administrators  from regional schools. The courses will present science as a  seamless whole through a blending of discovery-based activities  and cooperative learning in a technology-rich environment.  While this is a content curriculum, it will present science in  ways that model the best teaching practices.&quot;,\n",

       "  &apos;We propose the development of a new approach for teaching  introduction to computing courses, tailored to the needs of  students in different curricula. This approach is based on the  following precepts:   1. There is a strong need for students in all curricula to  understand the concepts of programming a computer, particularly in  the sciences and engineering fields.   2. It may no longer be necessary for students in many majors to  know how to write programs in traditional block-structured  languages (such as Pascal).   3. There is a wealth of software in wide use today which allows  the user to write programs in specialized built-in macro languages.   4. Teaching programming concepts through the use of powerful,  user-friendly software with programmable features allows the user  to write programs immediately which produce nontrivial results.  This provides stronger motivation to learn programming than  traditional approaches.  Moreover, the essential concepts of computer programming, (such as  variable, branching, iteration, etc.) can be readily illustrated  and implemented using the sophisticated features of a variety of  commonly available software packages, such as word processors,  spreadsheets, and databases. The main intention of our approach is  to teach programming concepts and techniques, not simply how to use  software. Students will be exposed to the kinds of functionality  common to all languages, thus facilitating the learning of a  general purpose language or new, innovative software they will need  for pursuing both their education and their careers in science,  engineering, or teaching.   This project will focus on two courses, a general introduction to  scientific and statistical programming for science majors and an  introductory programming course for computer science majors. It  will focus on developing a set of modules to illustrate the  programming concepts exhibited by various pieces of software in the  Drexel &quot;bundle&quot; which each freshman obtains. In addition to the  modules, examples and exercises will be created in the two subject  matter areas.&apos;,\n",

       "  &quot;The adoption of technology by education has always lagged  behind the same technology&apos;s widespread use by other  segments of society. The pace of technology development,  and the impact this pace has on society, coupled with the  massive problems of science and mathematics education in  this country, has made this time lag no longer tenable. As  a society, we can not afford inefficient and limited use of  the capabilities of technology to help educators attack the  problems of education for all citizens.   The full participation of educational professional  associations in defining a policy along these lines is a  fundamental component of planning how to accelerate the pace  of adoption of technology by education. The presence of  many such associations in the Washington, DC area offers a  good opportunity for taking first steps towards assessing  teh state of knowledge by educational leaders, and for  creating a forum to help coordinate their activities.   The outcome of this project will be a clearer definition of  who are the stakeholders for the incorporation of  technologies in education, a membership profile of the  associations, their leaders, and their technology awareness  and plans, and a series of targeted forums and discussions  where educational leaders and NSF program officers can  interact and explore policy issues related to the adoption  of telecommunication technologies in education.&quot;,\n",

       "  &quot;The American Association for the Advancement of  Science (AAAS) is publishing and disseminating  two booklets, Find Your Future and You&apos;re in  Charge, for precollege and undergraduate students  with disabilities to motivate them towards education  and careers in science and engineering. The  booklets include a rationale for choosing a science-  based career and encouragement to seek out  postsecondary institutions that offer science and  engineering curricula. The booklets include much  practical advice on admissions, orientation,  establishing support services, interaction with  faculty, asssistive technology, and pre-career science  work experiences.   The booklets were developed in 1987-89 as part of  an NSF-funded research project conducted by  American Institutes of Research (AIR) and AAAS  on critical factors contributing to entry and  advancement by persons with disabilities in science,  mathematics, and engineering fields. In the course  of the study, 280 working scientists and engineers  and students with disabilities were interviewed. The  content of the booklets was developed from these  interviews.   AAAS will design and publish the booklets in an  attractive format and will do some editing so that  the legislative information and language meet 1992  standards. Announcements about the availability of  the booklets will be placed in both the science  education and disability press and announced in  electronic networks. Single copies will be  distributed with a cover letter/return sheet to obtain  feedback. Multiple copies will be distributed at  appropriate meetings.&quot;,\n",

       "  &apos;SOUNDPRINT, the weekly half-hour nationally broadcast public  radio documentary series, proposes a 16-program SOUNDPRINT  SCIENCE SERIES comprising four thematic components of four  programs each, which explore and examine current issues and  ideas in the areas of 1) Biodiversity and Species Management;  2) Invasions: The Predator and the Prey; 3) Cultural  Geography; and 4) The Meanings of Science.   The series offers listeners a variety of experiences  illustrative of the breadth of what is defined as science.  Scientific thought and method are presented through a  humanistic storytelling approach that capitalizes on the  imaginative quality of sound to immerse listeners in the  exploration of phenomena. Each documentary explores a single  subject, placing it in a meaningful context, and taking  listeners beyond the surface of simple fact reporting.  Programs translate complex scientific ideas into accessible,  memorable stories that increase awareness and understanding of  science for a broad population (SOUNDPRINT REACHES OVER  250,000 LISTENERS EACH WEEK).   The SOUNDPRINT SCIENCE SERIES will be broad cast as a series  of quarterly, month-long specials, with promotional, education  and community outreach materials provided to stations. Post-  broadcast application of the programs includes development of  teacher guide packets targeted to the middle school level and  repacking of programs for educational purposes in multi-media  and interactive settings. Cassette copies of programs are  shared by listeners in professional, educational, and informal  settings.   Major scientific disciplines involved include: biology,  environmental sciences, geography, life sciences, mathematics  and physics.   The Proposed SOUNDPRINT SCIENCES SERIES is submitted to the  National Science Foundation Informal Science Education  Program.   Programs in the series are geared to a broad, general  audience, elementary through adult populations.&apos;,\n",

This program will provide  three-week summer workshops and follow-up support to  leadership teams of teachers, school administrators, and  community partners from 16 urban sites. These teams will  become experts in the use of GrowLab, an instructional  program developed with NSF support by the National Gardening  Association, and Fast Plants, another NSF-supported  instructional program, developed at the University of  Wisconsin. Private businesses and informal learning centers  such as botanical gardens and horticultural clubs will  provide content support to teachers. The teams of  participating teachers will offer professional development  opportunities to other teachers in their region, and act as  advocates for inquiry-centered teaching in elementary  classrooms. More than 360 teachers, administrators, and  community partners will be reached directly or indirectly by  this program of leadership development. A national network  and newsletter will also disseminate news of this project.   Cost sharing represents 50% of the NSF contribution.&apos;,\n",

Studies indicate that lipid from subcellular organelles in addition to the plasma membrane must be accessible in order to account for the large amount of PtdIns that is often involved in the cycling response. To date, two mechanisms have been proposed to explain this: (1) A PtdIns transfer protein facilitates the transfer of intracellular PtdIns to the plasma membrane, and (2) The bulk of the PtdIns metabolized is hydrolyzed directly, perhaps as a result of the rise in intracellular free calcium, and is not involved in the generation of inositol tris phosphate second messengers or directly associated with a hormone-receptor complex. A third possibility is suggested: (3) Internal membrane PtdIns is accessed as a result of receptor sequestration and recycling through the interior of the cell. A series of experiments have been devised to test this third possibility. They involve inhibition of internalization by potassium depletion as well as by receptor mutation. As a corollary to this hypothesis, compensatory resynthesis of PtdIns need not take place at the plasma membrane. The subcellular location of the PtdIns synthetase enzyme will be determined by immunocytochemistry. %%% One important signaling pathway in the response of cells to hormones involves the breakdown of a membrane component known as phosphatidylinositol bis-phosphate to produce further signal molecules. To maintain a cell's ability to respond to hormone, this material must be resynthesized. The goal of this research is to determine where within the cell resynthesis takes place and how it is controlled in coordination with hormonal stimulation of the cell. The results of this research will contribute important new information on how cells respond to hormones and other external signals.</td><td> July 1, 1993 </td><td> MCB </td><td> Cyclic Phosphatidylinositol Metabolism and Resynthesis</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220004.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 42 Geological Sciences </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220004</td><td> 1573 PETROLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY</td><td> January 31, 1994 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Columbia University\t 1210 Amsterdam Avenue; MC 2205\t New York, NY 10027 212/854-6851</td><td> $40000 (Estimated)</td><td> Jonathan H.

The focus is on two important problems. The first is to understand the processes responsible for the observed behavior, so that constitutive equations can be based on known processes. This is important for extrapolating laboratory results over large time and distance scales to earthquakes. The second problem is to understand the reason for differences in large displacement experiments between velocity weakening behavior of friction samples using initially bare surfaces and velocity strengthening behavior of samples using simulated gouge. Understanding the correlations between frictional behavior and structures in these samples will help ascertain what behavior may be associated with structures observed in natural faults. Experiments will be conducted using a unique high pressure rotary shear apparatus well suited for this purpose. Experiments will be done on rock types of geological importance with known flow and fracture properties. Pore fluid chemistry, sliding rate and temperature will be varied to determine how frictional behavior depends on these variables and to help identify operative processes. ***</td><td> August 1, 1993 </td><td> EAR </td><td> Rock Friction Constitutive Experiments as Related to Theory of Earthquake Instability</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220008.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 42 Geological Sciences </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220008</td><td> 1571 GEOLOGY & PALEONTOLOGY</td><td> December 31, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> PA St U University Park\t 201 Old Main\t University Park, PA 168021503 814/865-4700</td><td> $101250 (Estimated)</td><td> John A.

Yet various sources of geological evidence suggest high atmospheric pCO2 at this time, and Berner's (1990,1991) Geochemical cycling model indicates that the amount may have been as high or higher than 13 times the present atmospheric level. To resolve this apparent paradox (high pCO2 would be expected to imply an ice- free Earth) the following approach will be followed: 1) Two periods will be studied: the Middle Ordovician, which lacks evidence for polar ice, and the Ashgill (Late Ordovician) which has evidence for the largest ice extend. 2) An atmospheric general circulation model GCM will be applied to the study of Ordovician climates, and the results of this will then be used to drive a spatially resolved geochemical cycling model (which considers geographical variations in climate and paleolithology). We will first model the climates of both periods with a CO2 level of 13xPAL. If differences in geography cannot account for the climate difference then we will progressively lover the Late Ordovician CO2 levels until we find that snow remains throughout the year where the geological evidence indicates an ice cap. In this way we can determine the range of pCO2 values which is climatically compatible with the glaciological evidence . We will then run a global geochemical cycling model, in part to provide an additional means of estimating/confirming pCO2 by seeing which climate, i.e., weathering regime, generates a CO2 consumption rate that is consistent with the inferred rate of production via volcanism and metamorphism. In particular we will examine the hypothesis that increased (terrestrial) volcanism in the Middle Ordovician led to increased (terrestrial) silicate weathering in the Late Ordovician. Increased weathering would mean that the carbon cycle was in balance at a lower pCO2 level than current model indicate, and thus allow glaciation. This study of the Middle and Late Ordovician will allow us to look at the evolution to a glaciated state, and will be a test of the importance of atmospheric CO2 as a prime governor of climate on Earth.</td><td> January 15, 1993 </td><td> EAR </td><td> Global Change: Atmospheric pCO2 and Glaciation- A Coupled Paleoclimatic and Geochemical Cycling Study of the Late Ordovician/Early Silurian</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220009.txt</td><td> 0311000 Polar Programs-Related 44 Physical & Chemical Oceanography </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220009</td><td> 5113 ANTARCTIC OCEANS & CLIMATE SYS</td><td> June 30, 1996 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> Columbia University\t 1210 Amsterdam Avenue; MC 2205\t New York, NY 10027 212/854-6851</td><td> $329118 (Estimated)</td><td> Bernhard Lettau \t OPP OFFICE OF POLAR PROGRAMS \t O/D OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR </td><td> a9220009</td><td> 0000,OTHR,</td><td> Stanley S.

Upwelling warm deep water covers the Amundsen and Bellings-hausen shelves and delivers significant amounts of heat to the sea ice and fringing ice shelves. The regional precipitation is heavy, and has historically maintained a perennial ice cover. However, within the last few years satellite images have shown that the ice has been receding dramatically, with large areas of open water persisting through the winter in sectors that earlier had been ice-covered. These anomalous ice distributions are likely to have been accompanied by altered surface water properties, and possibly changes in the deep vertical circulation. There are indications that the conditions favoring a reduction in the sea ice may migrate westward toward the Ross Sea, and may have influenced a gradual warming over recent decades on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula.

There are several reasons why this enzyme is being studied. One is that MMO plays a key ecological role in recapturing of billions of tons of the greenhouse gas, methane, into biomass. If this enzyme suddenly disappeared from the face of the earth, all that methane would be released into the atmosphere. Second, the reaction catalyzed by MMO is important in the production of clean burning fuels. An understanding of how MMO functions could assist in the design of improved catalysts for this process. Third, MMO produces an extremely reactive species that is capable of inserting an oxygen into virtually any C-H bond.

The three broad but specific objectives of the proposed research are to develop and test scaling theories of spatial variability, (i) in hydrologic fluxes in river basins, (ii) in link based descriptions of three- dimensional channel network geometry, and (iii) to establish and employ appropriate data bases for a few select basins for testing theoretical hypotheses and predictions.

While bacteria ordinarily contain MnSOD, FeSOD, or both in the cytoplasm, a small number contain a periplasmic CuZnSOD, called bacteriocuprein. The periplasmic location of bacteriocupreins suggests that they defend against oxyradical stress originating outside the cell. The goal of this project is to investigate the physiological function and structure of this SOD type in bacterial species exposed to external oxyradical stress. Two bacterial cell models will be studied. Caulobacter crescentus, a pond bacterium that tolerates high concentrations of oxygen, and Legionella pneumophila, a pulmonary pathogen that escapes oxygen-dependent killing by macrophages. In C. crescentus, SOD function will be studied by measuring transcriptional activation in gene fusions of periplasmic CuZnSOD and cytoplasmic FeSOD. In L. pneumophila the CuZnSOD gene will be cloned and a mutant lacking CuZnSOD will be constructed and characterized. In these studies, the mutants and gene fusion strains will be exposed to internal and external oxyradical stresses. In addition, the ability to invade, multiply and to grow in a HL-60 macrophage system will be studied for the L. pneumophila mutants. %%% Many microorganisms can be killed by toxic forms of oxygen, a gas we breath, but a few types of bacteria are resistant. It has been proposed that the resistant bacteria survive because they can make special enzymes that fight against the energized, toxic forms of oxygen. One unusual enzyme that can fight against \"toxic\" oxygen was discovered in my laboratory. This basic research project will study the structure of the unusual enzyme and determine how it works to destroy \"toxic\" oxygen, thereby allowing the cells to survive and grow in its presence.</td><td> February 1, 1993 </td><td> MCB </td><td> Bacteriocuprein Superoxide Dismutases</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220056.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 42 Geological Sciences </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220056</td><td> 1571 GEOLOGY & PALEONTOLOGY</td><td> August 31, 1994 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> U of Southern California\t University Park\t Los Angeles, CA 900891147 213/740-2934</td><td> $44111 (Estimated)</td><td> John A.

A region like the northwestern Himalaya provides a particularly intriguing site for the study of evolving topography, because it is characterized by rapid Quaternary denudation, differential uplift, rivers showing some of the highest gradients and largest sediments loads in the world, a breadth of climatic regimes, active tectonicsm, and extreme topographic relief. In the absence of knowledge of rates of denudation, bedrock uplift, and surface uplift, reconstructions or models of topographic development are forced to rely on untested assumptions concerning the absolute magnitude and relative importance of each of these factors. In the northwestern Himalaya and Karakoram, it appears possible however, to combine digital elevation data sets with chronologic and geomorphic data on timing and magnitude of incision, erosion, and uplift in order to provide a calibrated perspective on topographic evolution of this dynamic region. The goals of this study are to define the timing and rates of incision and bedrock cooling in this part of the Himalayan orogen; to make volumetric approximations of regional denudation, reconstruct base- level changes along this part of the Indus River; and to reconstruct the interactions among tectonically generated localized uplift, regional uplift (tectonic or isostatic), and erosion and denudation. The approaches that will be used include: exposure-age dating of strath surfaces using cosmogenic nuclides; development of cooling ages histories using multi-mineral dating of vertical relief sections; reconstruction of river profiles based on temporal and geometric constraints; and analysis of slopes, altitudinal distributions, gradients, and volumes based on digital elevation data set for the NW Himalaya.</td><td> March 1, 1993 </td><td> EAR </td><td> COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Calibration of Late Cenozoic Incision, Uplift, and Erosion Along the Indus River, Northern Pakistan</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220059.txt</td><td> 0111000 Science Policy 0308000 Industrial Technology 0522500 Early Technology 91 Science Technology Assess </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220059</td><td> 8815 RESEARCH ON SCIENCE & TECHNLGY</td><td> February 28, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Rensselaer Polytech Inst\t 110 8th Street\t Troy, NY 121803522 518/276-6000</td><td> $70004 (Estimated)</td><td> Leonard L.

Numerical experiments completed thus far for a volumetrically heated fluid cooled from above show that fluid below the thermal boundary layer at the top boundary is substantially non-adiabatic, contrary to the usual assumptions about the structure of thermal convection at high Ra. The structure of the flow consists of nearly axisymmetric plumes that are fed by the cold boundary layer. Linear structures, that would presumably represent subduction zones in the convecting mantle, appear only infrequently. The PI will carry out further numerical experiments that include heating from below as well as volumetric heating. The principal innovation is a multigrid iterative solver for buoyant viscous flow that is an order of magnitude or more faster than the FFT methods that have frequently been used in 3D convection problems. The PI will extend development of multigrid solvers to buoyant fiscous flow with variable viscosity. This will be carried out by solving equations formulated in primitive variable (pressures and velocity components) rather than in vector streamfunction and vorticity or some other potential function formulation. The first application of this new methodology will be to understand how temperature and depth dependent viscosity modify results of the constant viscosity, high Rayleigh number numerical experiments. ***</td><td> August 1, 1993 </td><td> EAR </td><td> 3D Thermal Convection in an Infinite Prandtl Number Fluid with Application to Mantle Dynamics</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220065.txt</td><td> 0311000 Polar Programs-Related 42 Geological Sciences </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220065</td><td> 5112 ANTARCTIC GEOLOGY & GEOPHYSICS</td><td> July 31, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Woods Hole Ocean Inst\t Woods Hole, MA 02543 508/548-1400</td><td> $122438 (Estimated)</td><td> Scott Borg \t OPP OFFICE OF POLAR PROGRAMS \t O/D OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR </td><td> a9220065</td><td> </td><td> Mark D.

The goals of this award are to: 1) characterize the mantle source beneath the region and understand its origin, and 2) determine the relationship between the volcanism and the proposed hotspot and/or extension-related tectonic origin. Existing isotopic data suggest that these basalts have unique radiogenic lead and non-radiogenic strontium isotopic compositions that are compatible with derivation from a hypothetical class of mantle called HIMU (meaning high uranium to lead ratio). This type of mantle could be produced by one or more of the following processes; recycling of oceanic crust into the mantle, metasomatic addition of uranium, metasomatic removal of rubidium, or lead loss to the core. Helium isotopes have not yet been used extensively to study HIMU mantle. However, helium isotopes will be useful for characterizing HIMU mantle sources of basalts and identifying the processes involved in its production because helium isotopes can help distinguish between undepleted mantle and mantle that has been involved in mid-ocean ridge or subduction processes. Thus, helium isotopic data from the McMurdo Sound region will help to understand the nature and origin of HIMU mantle sources in Antarctica and elsewhere in the world. In addition, new helium isotopic data from this area, coupled with strontium, neodymium, and lead isotopes, will help determine whether the McMurdo Sound basalts are associated with a hot mantle plume, involving undepleted mantle, or whether they are associated with extension related magmatism that would not require involvement of a mantle plume. Isotopic ages of the volcanic rocks which would be produced in the course of this work will also help document the temporal and tectonic controls on volcanism.</td><td> August 1, 1993 </td><td> OPP </td><td> Sources of Cenozoic Volcanism in McMurdo Sound: An Isotopic Study</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220066.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 42 Geological Sciences </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220066</td><td> 1572 TECTONICS</td><td> December 31, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> San Diego State Univ Fdn\t 5250 Campanile Drive\t San Diego, CA 921821931 619/594-5731</td><td> $78180 (Estimated)</td><td> Thomas O.

They act rapidly through the mediation of a single receptor or multiple receptors to cause changes in cell wall properties and gene expression. There are now several candidate auxin receptors in plants; however, their roles in growth and development have not yet been determined. These putative receptors are therefore designated \"auxin-binding proteins\" (ABP's). This project focuses on the characterization of two such ABP's, designated ABP1 and 65-kDa ABP. ABP1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that contains an ER-retention sequence; yet, this laboratory has demonstrated that a significant amount of this protein escapes the ER retention mechanism and uniquely migrates to the plasma membrane / cell wall space. This cell wall localization is consistent with its postulated site of action. The 65-kDa subunit ABP, recently identified in this laboratory using anti- idiotypic antibodies, is a nuclear localized protein. Preliminary data suggest that it binds DNA. The hypothesis is put forward that this putative receptors is involved in auxin-regulated gene transcription. %%% It has been known for many years that plant growth and development is regulated by plant hormones, principally auxins (e.g., indole acetic acid, or IAA) and cytokines. However, despite a great deal of effort, it is not yet understood how plant hormones exert their effects at a molecular level. Auxin-binding proteins, such as ABP1 and the 65-kDa ABP which are the subject of this project, have been described, but it has not yet been established for any of these that they are functional \"auxin receptors,\" let alone mechanisms of action. This laboratory has made some very interesting and novel findings, such as the auxin-dependent subcellular localization of ABP1 and the nuclear localization and DNA binding characteristics of 65-kDa ABP, which may lead to breakthroughs in this area.

The work proposed here is designed to gain a clear understanding of the enzymes influenced by ecdysone which result in sex pheromone production and to provide the basic information necessary to develop insect control strategies based on inhibiting sex pheromone production.</td><td> February 1, 1993 </td><td> IBN </td><td> Endocrine Regulation of Sex Phermone Production in the Housefly</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220094.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 42 Geological Sciences </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220094</td><td> 1572 TECTONICS</td><td> December 31, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Rensselaer Polytech Inst\t 110 8th Street\t Troy, NY 121803522 518/276-6000</td><td> $76276 (Estimated)</td><td> Roy K.

In plants, the mevalonic acid pathway participates in the synthesis of cytokinins, abscisic acid, gibberellins, ubiquinones, plastoquinones, dolichols, sterols, carotenoids, chlorophylls, and numerous other isoprenoids. However, it is not clear whether these small isoprenoids fully account for the mevalonic acid growth requirement of plant cells. In mammalian and yeast cells, it has been shown that products of mevalonic acid are covalently bound to G-proteins, low molecular weight ras-like GTP-binding proteins and nuclear lamins. Covalent attachment of isoprenoids to these proteins is required for their assembly into membranes and, hence, for their role in signal transduction and cell growth control. Given the recent discovery of G-proteins and ras-like GTP-binding proteins in plants, it was predicted that plants also contain isoprenylated proteins. Preliminary data shown in this proposal indicate that plants contain isoprenylated, membrane-associated proteins similar in mass to ras-like GTP-binding proteins and nuclear lamins. The goals of this project are to determine the structure of the isoprenoid modification of these proteins and to identify the proteins. This work will lead to and understanding of the role of protein isoprenylation in plant cell growth, phytohormone action, signal transduction, and membrane biogenesis. %%% Isoprenoids belong to a specialized class of lipid molecules.

In this project the principal investigators will combine experimental petrology and geochemistry, observational seismology, isotope and trace element geochemistry and laboratory convection experiments with numerical approaches to the thermal structure and large-scale convection of the slab and mantle wedge, and porous flow models for melt and fluid migration in the arc environment. Heat flow and various analyses of seismic data, from primarily the Japan arc, will constrain the thermal structure and rheological properties used in the initial calculations (2-D and some 3-D) of flow in the slab and mantle, using a temperature-dependent viscosity. Models developed for Japan, where seismic constraints are strongest, will be used as a base for Central America and for the Cascades, where a young hot plate is subducting and conditions are far from steady state. Models for transport of hydrous fluids in the vicinity of the slab, and of melts through the mantle will be calculated using the stress and flow fields from the thermal and convection modeling. Plate scale mass transport delivers chemical elements derived from the continental crust, hydrosphere and lithosphere to the deep source of arc magmas; fluid and melt transport processes translate some fraction of these elements back to the surface in crust building magmas. Documentably slab-derived elements such as 10Be (1.5 Ma half-life), B and U (75 ka half-life in disequilibria series) will be incorporated as chemical tracers in fluid/melt migration models, with fluxes, transport paths and characteristic transport times constrained from chemistry of subconducting sediments and erupting lavas. Fluid partitioning studies on key elements will further constrain input to migration models. Predictions from coupled thermal, convection and transport models regarding spatial distribution, character and chemistry of lavas along the length and across the width of arcs will be compared with observed values, and evaluated against observed variations in subduction parameters from arc to arc to arrive at an integrated model of the subduction cycle and its role in crustal growth and evolution of the mantle. ***</td><td> September 1, 1993 </td><td> EAR </td><td> Collaborative Research: A Combined Observational and Theoretical Investigation of Thermal and Chemical Transport in Subduction Zones and the Evolution of Active...</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220108.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 61 Life Science Biological </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220108</td><td> 1136 SIGNAL TRANSDCTN/CELL REGULATN</td><td> February 28, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> U of Colorado Denver\t Campus Box 129 PO Box 173364\t Denver, CO 802173364 303/556-4060</td><td> $312778 (Estimated)</td><td> Barbara K.

It is known that phorbols act through protein kinase C, but the pathway to cell division beyond protein kinase C is not known. Protein kinase C is also believed to be involved in the proliferative pathway of ras p21, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and some other growth factors. Since phorbols, ras p21, insulin and IGF-1 initiate meiotic cell division in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we will examine whether PKC acts through regulation of one or more of four different cell cycle regulatory proteins. With both in vivo and in vitro studies, the phosphorylation, amount and activity of ras p21, mos, cyclin, and p34cdc2 will be examined as a function of protein kinase C activity. It may be found that only one isozymic form of PKC is central to the regulation of proliferation and that PKC induces cell division through regulation of specific protein(s). This research should elucidate heretofore uncharacterized steps in the pathway to cell division. %%% Certain plant products, phorbol esters, induce cell division in animal cells. These chemicals activate an enzyme known as protein kinase C (PKC). The function of protein kinase C is to transfer phosphate groups onto other proteins. Much evidence suggests that growth hormones such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 and epidermal growth factor induce cell division by activating protein kinase C. The steps beyond activation of protein kinase C which lead to cell division are not known. A separate line of research over the past five years has been the search for genes and proteins important to cell division. Some of the newly discovered proteins are called mos, cyclin, p34cdc2 and ras p21. The goals of this research are: (a) to determine whether protein kinase C can transfer phosphate to these proteins in a test tube or in living cells, (b) if i t does, to locate the site of phosphate addition to these proteins, and (c) determine whether these important cell division proteins are turned on or off by the addition of phosphate. The results of this research should define new steps in the sequence of events that leads to induction of cell division by growth factors. Since this research will be carried out at an undergraduate institution with the participation of students, it will also contribute to training a future generation of scientists. ***</td><td> September 1, 1993 </td><td> MCB </td><td> RUI: Induction of Cell Division by Protein Kinase C</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220110.txt</td><td> 0201000 Agriculture 61 Life Science Biological </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220110</td><td> 1136 SIGNAL TRANSDCTN/CELL REGULATN</td><td> April 30, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> U of Washington\t 3935 University Way NE\t Seattle, WA 981056613 206/543-4043</td><td> $324983 (Estimated)</td><td> Barbara K.

To date, most studies of this relationship have concentrated on simply describing patterns of association. This research will go beyond a descriptive approach, and probe the mechanisms that generate patterns of association between selected seabirds and patches of krill. The focus is on seabird species that are abundant at South Georgia in winter and that are known to feed heavily on krill: Gentoo Penguins, Common Diving-Petrels, Kerguelen Petrels and Blue Petrels. The study includes several components. These include the quantification of seabird distribution relative to the location and size of krill patches and the quantification of individual behavior of seabirds as a function of krill density, krill patch size, distance from krill patches and abundance of other consumers. Data on individual behavior will be used to construct partial differential equation models of seabird distribution. Patterns of association predicted by these models will be compared to observed patterns of association. Finally, an assessment of how birds actually capture prey such as krill, and how the potential cost of foraging increases as weather conditions become severe, will be made. This research will unite several lines of investigation into a synthesized portrait of how birds respond to spatial and temporal variability in resources within the Antarctic environment.</td><td> February 15, 1993 </td><td> OPP </td><td> Foraging Behavior and the Dispersion of Pelagic Birds</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220130.txt</td><td> 0204000 Oceanography 43 Biological Oceanography </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220130</td><td> 1650 BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY</td><td> June 30, 1993 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> U of Cal San Diego\t 9500 Gilman Drive, Dept. 0934\t La Jolla, CA 920930934 858/534-0246</td><td> $50000 (Estimated)</td><td> \t OCE DIVISION OF OCEAN SCIENCES \t GEO DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES </td><td> a9220130</td><td> 9237,</td><td> Farooq Azam (Principal Investigator current)</td><td> September 11, 1992 </td><td> The quantitative role of bacteriophages in the biogeochemical cycles of the marine environment is a most urgent question.

The working hypothesis for the NO3-fed, root GS impaired plants is that the NO3-taken up by the root instead of being distributed between the root and leaves for assimilation is now exclusively assimilated in the leaves. Being energetically more efficient to assimilate NO3-in the photosynthetic tissue, the result is more efficient usage of nitrogen. In the case of the nodulated alfalfa plants, it is postulated that all the photosynthate normally distributed between the roots and the nodules is now directed primarily to the nodules. The increased flow of photosynthate to the nodules provides more energy substrate for the bacteroides to fix N2 and more C-skeleton for assimilating the fixed N2, resulting in increased N2-fixation rates and ammonia assimilation. The experimental approach to impair root GS activity is to use the antisense RNA technology. To specifically target the root GS, antisense gene constructs consisting of either the constitutive 35S promoter and a root GS specific sequence or a root specific/enhanced promoter and a GS coding sequence in antisense orientation have been introduced into alfalfa via Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation of leaf discs. To ensure that GS activity in nodules is not impaired, root GS impaired alfalfa transformants will be transformed with GS gene sense contructs behind the leghemoglobin gene promoter or the nodule-specific GS gene promoter. Since the effects of increased GS activity is not known, alfalfa plants have also been transformed with GS sense constructs under the control of constitutive and root specific/enhanced promoters. Both molecular and biochemical analysis of the different tissues will be performed to test for changes in expression of genes encoding key enzymes in N- and C- metabolism. Besides allowing us to understand why root GS impaired plants perform better, this analyses will allow us to determine if changes in N-metabolism has any effect on C-metabolism. Availability of root GS impaired plants will provide us with the necessary tools to test our hypothesis with and eventually allow us to manipulate plants for better usage of N and C.</td><td> April 1, 1993 </td><td> IBN </td><td> Impairment of Root GS Activity in Alfalfa by Antesense RNA Technology and Its Effect on NO3-Assimilation, Nodulation and N2-Fixation</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220145.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 61 Life Science Biological </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220145</td><td> 1118 PLANT & MICRO DEVELOP MECHANSM</td><td> October 31, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> PA St U University Park\t 201 Old Main\t University Park, PA 168021503 814/865-4700</td><td> $454000 (Estimated)</td><td> Judith Plesset \t IBN DIV OF INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY AND NEUROSCIE\t BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </td><td> a9220145</td><td> 0000,9109,9178,9251,OTHR,SMET,</td><td> Teh-hui Kao txk3@psu.edu (Principal Investigator current)</td><td> March 13, 1996 </td><td> Self-incompatible Petunia inflata and a self-compatible cultivar of Petunia hybrida will be used as model systems in an ongoing study of the molecular, biochemical, and genetic bases of gametophytic self-incompatibility.

Two approaches will be taken: a) transgenic P. inflata plants obtained by introducing S1-gene into S3S3 genotype, and S3-gene into S1S1 genotype, will be tested to see whether the ability to reject pollen bearing S1-allele and S3-allele respectively has been conferred by the transgenes; b) antisense S1-gene will be introduced into P. inflata plants with S1S3 genotype to see whether the ability to reject S1-bearing pollen is annulled in the transgenic plants. The second objective is to determine the regulatory sequences for the pistil-specific expression of the S- gene and rnx2 gene (encoding RNase X2) by examining the expression of a series of promoter-GUS constructs via transient assays and in stable transformants.

Understanding how these adhesive proteins work will help us understand the basis of certain cell-cell interactions. One of the best studied cell adhesion molecules is the neural cell adhesion molecule or N-CAM which is found on the surfaces of many nerve cells. N-CAM was originally shown to bind directly to other N-CAM molecules. More recent work from this laboratory and others has altered our picture of N-CAM-mediated adhesion by suggesting that N-CAM can also bind to target molecules other that N-CAM. This would greatly broaden the range of interactions in which this molecule could participate. Other than N-CAM itself, the identities of the molecules that are targets for N-CAM binding are not yet known. The goal of this project is to identify these target molecules and to define the chemical and cellular properties of adhesion to them. The first aim of the study will be to test whether a particular group of molecules found on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix, namely heparan sulfate proteoglycans, can act as the target for cell adhesion brought about by N-CAM. These molecules have been implicated in other adhesive systems, but their direct role as an adhesive target for N-CAM has not been demonstrated. The second aim of the study will be to identify and purify from cell surfaces as-yet undiscovered proteins that act as targets for N-CAM binding.

This binding initiates two processes. In the first, the receptor itself is chemically modified by the addition of phosphate functions to signal the cell to the presence of insulin. The cell then modifies its metabolism in response to this signal. In the second process, insulin binding causes the insulin- receptor complex to be taken into the cell itself. In the past, these two processes have been studied as independent, unrelated events. However, preliminary data indicate that these two processes are inter-dependent, related events. The receptor acquires more phosphate as it moves from the plasma membrane into the cell. In addition, the highly phosphorylated receptor also is a better signal-mediator than the less phosphorylated receptor at the plasma membrane. The goals of this project are to understand how these phosphate groups are added to and removed from the insulin receptor, and if, in the intact cell, the highly phosphorylated internal receptor is involved in the generation of the insulin signal.</td><td> May 1, 1993 </td><td> IBN </td><td> Insulin Receptor Metabolism: Routing and Signal Transduction</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220176.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 61 Life Science Biological </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220176</td><td> 1116 EUKARYOTIC GENETICS</td><td> July 31, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> The Scripps Research Inst\t 10550 North Torrey Pines Road\t La Jolla, CA 920371027 / -</td><td> $200000 (Estimated)</td><td> \t MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE\t BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </td><td> a9220176</td><td> 9109,</td><td> Curtis A.

This hypersensitive response (HR) limits the virus to the infection site and prevents it from spreading throughout the plant. Although many of the metabolic changes associated with HR are known, the nature and function of the genes that control the response remain a mystery. A novel strategy for the isolation of host genes that control a HR against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) has been conceived. A full-length, infectious cDNA clone of TMV has been modified to permit the introduction of foreign open reading frames in place of the viral coat protein gene. Foreign genes inserted into this viral vector are expressed in planta with protein levels ranging from approximately 0.1% to 1% of the total extractable protein. The isolation of HR-specific genes using the TMV-based expression vector will involve the \"shotgun\" cloning of pooled cDNAs derived from HR-positive host plants into the universal cloning sites of the vector. In vitro transcription reactions will be performed, and the transcribed RNAs will be inoculated directly onto appropriate host plants that lack the HR- controlling genes (\"systemic hosts\"). The inoculated leaves will be monitored for the appearance of necrotic infection sites or other evidence of HR. Individual viruses eliciting a HR will be propagated and viral RNA will be extracted. The segment of the viral RNA representing the cDNA inserted into the cloning site of the TMV vector will be amplified by PCR techniques using primers that flank the inserted gene. The genes will be sequenced and will be used as probes for the analysis of RNA expression in plant tissues before and during viral infection. Antibody preparations generated in rabbits immunized with proteins produced in E. coli will also allow the analysis of protein expression patterns. %%% The successful development of this technique would allow very important plant resistance genes to be cloned and characterized after many failures to do so by other productive research workers.</td><td> February 1, 1993 </td><td> MCB </td><td> Rapid Isolation of Plant Hypersensitive Response Genes Usinga Viral Expression Vector</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220180.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 81 Anthropology </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220180</td><td> 1390 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY</td><td> December 31, 1994 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> U of Kentucky Res Fdn\t 201 Kinkead Hall\t Lexington, KY 405060057 / -</td><td> $9000 (Estimated)</td><td> Raymond B.

Like all proteins, tropomyosin is composed of a linear sequence of amino acid sub-units. Although we know that the function of a protein depends on the chemical properties of its amino acids, very little is known about how the specific amino acids in tropomyosin help to regulate muscle contraction. The long-term goal of this research program is a more detailed understanding of the relationship between the amino acid composition of tropomyosin and the role of the protein in muscle cells. Animals have several kinds of muscle, with unique properties. What imparts this uniqueness? The intriguing observation has been made that different muscles contain different versions of the contractile proteins, where each version, known as an isoform, has a unique amino acid sequence. Tropomyosin is one of the contractile proteins with a muscle-specific distribution of isoforms. The short-term objective of this project is to determine whether different tropomyosin isoforms endow muscles with distinctive contractile properties. We are focusing on an isoform of tropomyosin found in the indirect flight muscle of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Indirect flight muscle has special properties that allow it to move the wings rapidly during flight. The project will employ a mutant strain of Drosophila that is unable to fly because it does not produce enough of the flight muscle tropomyosin isoform. To determine whether the flight muscle isoform is essential for flight muscle function, flight muscle of the mutant strain will be supplemented with two non-flight muscle tropomyosins. Muscle structure and function will be analyzed. If tropomyosin isoforms are functionally interchangeable, the mutants will regain the ability to fly; if the flight muscle isoforms provides unique and essential contractile properties, the flies will remain flightless. Should we obtain the latter results, those segments of the flight muscle protein critical for flight muscle function will be identified. Before we can understand completely how the muscle cell works at the molecular level, the part played by each of the component proteins must be elucidated in as much detail as possible. The present study will expand our knowledge of tropomyosin's role.</td><td> May 1, 1993 </td><td> IBN </td><td> Structure/Function Relationships in Tropomyosin</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220186.txt</td><td> 0203000 Health 61 Life Science Biological </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220186</td><td> 1154 BIOCHEMISTRY OF GENE EXPRESSIO</td><td> November 30, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> Washington University\t St. Louis, MO 63130 314/889-5100</td><td> $255000 (Estimated)</td><td> Todd M.

The overall objective of this research is to elucidate at the molecular level the role(s) of ADP- riblosyltransferases (ADPRTases) in signal transduction and regulation of cellular functions. To achieve this goal, it will be necessary to (1) understand how the activity of these enzymes is regulated, (2) identify the proteins which serve as physiologically relevant targets for this post-translational modification, and (3) determine how the modification of these specific proteins controls cellular functions. Progress toward these goals is hampered by the lack of immunological and molecular genetic reagents for studying the modifying enzymes and target proteins involved in ADP- ribosylation reactions. For example, no gene for an endogenous ADPRTase has yet been cloned or sequenced. Likewise, no target protein for in vivo ADP-ribosylation has been identified. One specific goal of this proposal is to generate immunological and molecular genetic reagents to use as probes in addressing some of the important questions surrounding these post-translational modifications of proteins. The parallel and complementary aims of this study are (1) generation of antibodies that specifically recognize ADPRTases and ADP-ribosylated proteins and (2) molecular analysis of these proteins and their genes. %%% Many proteins are structurally modified after synthesis by addition of various small molecules. In some cases these modifications have been shown to play a pivotal role in the mechanism of action of the protein. For example, in many cellular responses to external stimuli the mechanism of signal transduction often involves the activation of an enzyme that adds or removes a phosphate group from some protein. Another type of protein modification is the addition of a molecule, known as adenosine diphosphoribose, derived from a vitamin and a sugar, to specific proteins. This chemical reaction is carried out by an enzyme known as adenosine diphosophoribosyl- transferases (ADPRTases). The overall goal of this research is to elucidate at the molecular level the role(s) of ADP- ribosyltransferases in signal transduction and regulation of cell functions. The near term objectives are to characterize ADP ribosyltransferases and to identify and characterize the physiologically important protein substrates of the ADPRTases. First it is necessary to develop biochemical and immunological tools to proceed with these studies. The results of this research should be an important contribution to understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which cells respond to external stimuli.</td><td> March 1, 1993 </td><td> MCB </td><td> ADP-Ribosylation and Regulation of Cellular Functions</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220194.txt</td><td> 0206000 Telecommunications 31 Computer Science & Engineering </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220194</td><td> 4091 NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE</td><td> April 30, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> U of Kentucky Res Fdn\t 201 Kinkead Hall\t Lexington, KY 405060057 / -</td><td> $22200 (Estimated)</td><td> Priscilla Jane Huston \t ANI DIV OF ADVANCED NETWOR INFRA & RESEARCH \t CSE DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR</td><td> a9220194</td><td> 9217,</td><td> Jeff Sun (Principal Investigator current)</td><td> November 13, 1992 </td><td> The National Distance Learning Center (NDLC) at Owensboro Community College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via an existing 1.544 million bits per second line through the University of Kentucky and the SURANET mid-level network.

The specific loop to be examined is the elastase-binding loop from the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) al-antitrypsin (AT). This ten-residue region has been successfully inserted into Interleukin-1b (IL-1b), replacing the turn connecting the fourth and fifth b-sheets. Because the original insertion placed the loop into part of a b sheet rather than entirely in the desired turn, new hybrids will be constructed by cassette mutagenesis. This loop, the inhibitor's reactive center, is of particular interest, since its intact structure has not been determined; comparison to other (non- inhibitory) members of the serpin family suggests that it may take on the form of a flexible a-helix. The structure of the reactive loops from a different class of serine-protease inhibitors, typified by soybean trypsin inhibitor, will be compared to that obtained for AT. The integrity of the loop will assessed by assaying for anti-protease activity in the recombinant proteins. Structures will be determined by X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).

With this technology, one can mutate genes by random insertion of promoter or gene trap constructs or by targeted homologous recombination, select cells with desired alterations, and then generate mutant organisms from them.

Usually the different alternative morphologies develop in different seasons of the year. In order to develop a different morphology it is necessary to activate a different set of genes, and thus the problem of control of polyphenism is to discover the mechanism by which an animal \"chooses\" between two alternative gene sets. The aim of the proposed research is to develop, for the first time, an understanding of complete pathway of genetic control in such a seasonal polyphenism. For this research we will use the butterfly, Precis coenia, which has a dramatic color polyphenism and for which our preliminary studies have already elucidated portions of the control pathway. The proposed research will identify the pigments responsible for the different color forms and the enzymes responsible for their synthesis. The genes for these enzymes will then be cloned so that we may develop tools to study the mechanism by which their expression is controlled. We know that a steroid hormone, 20-OH-ecdysone, is ultimately responsible for stimulating the genetic switch that causes the alternative pigment synthesis to occur, and experiments will be done to begin to investigate how this could control the differential expression of enzymes for the alternative pigments.</td><td> March 1, 1993 </td><td> IBN </td><td> Physiological Control of Gene Expression in a Seasonal Polyphenism</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220214.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 42 Geological Sciences </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220214</td><td> 1580 INSTRUMENTATION & FACILITIES</td><td> October 31, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> U of Georgia Res Fdn Inc\t 616 Boyd GSRC\t Athens, GA 306027411 706/542-5939</td><td> $30820 (Estimated)</td><td> Daniel F.

However, except for linear nucleic acids, very little is known regarding the nature of counterion accumulation. In order to address this issue, the current proposal outlines a combined computational/experimental approach to determine the extent of counterion association in the vicinity of various nucleic acid structures, including branched DNA and RNA helices. The computational approach (aim 1) will utilize a grand canonical ensemble Monte Carlo approach for the determination of ion accumulation. The principal experimental approach (aim 2), equilibrium dialysis, will measure the same quality. Finally, the technique of steady-state electrophoresis (SSE) will be employed (aim 3) to examine the relationship between thermodynamic ion binding and the effective charge of a nucleic acid undergoing electrophoresis. %%% Small ions in the vicinity of DNA or RNA molecules have a profound influence on the structures of those highly-charged macromolecules. Moreover, it is clear that such ions can participate in directing the binding of a wide variety of gene regulatory proteins to both DNA and RNA. Thus, the characterization of the interactions of small ions with higher-order nucleic acid structures is of great importance in understanding the broader issue of the regulation of gene expression. To this end, the goal of the proposed research is to characterize the net accumulation of small ions in the vicinity of simple branched nucleic acid structures, the latter being used as a paradigm for higher-order nucleic acid structure. The proposed work couples a theoretical analysis of small ion- macromolecule interactions with an experimental determination of the net accumulation of the small ions around the branch. The experimental work will employ a combination of dialysis and electrophoretic methods, which, when combined with the computational work, should provide the first quantitative view of the association of small ions around a higher-order nucleic acid structure -- a necessary antecedent for detailed studies of the salt-dependence of protein-nucleic acid interaction.</td><td> March 1, 1993 </td><td> MCB </td><td> Counterion Accumulation Around Finite Nucleic Acid Structures</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220236.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 13 Physics </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220236</td><td> 1223 ELE PARTICLE COSMIC RAYS & OTH</td><td> August 31, 1993 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Ohio State Univ Res Fdn\t 1960 Kenny Rd\t Columbus, OH 432101016 614/292-3732</td><td> $3000 (Estimated)</td><td> William Chinowsky \t PHY DIVISION OF PHYSICS \t MPS DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN</td><td> a9220236</td><td> </td><td> K.K.

Because of the lack of a urinary bladder, the urine of birds enters the terminal portion of the gastrointestinal tract, the cloaca. The urine does not remain here, but moves in an oral direction into the rectum where it comes into contact with epithelial tissues capable of active transport. Thus, conditions are created under which the composition of the urine can be modified. Because of this anatomical and functional relationship, the kidneys of birds do not have sole control of fluid and electrolyte balance, as is the case for mammals. In this proposal, I plan to investigate several components of this system. These are: 1) An investigation of the factors that control the movement of urine from the cloaca into the intestine. Does this movement occur at all times, or does it vary with the composition and volume of the urine? If it does vary, what parameters are sensed and how are they detected? 2) An investigation of the concentrating mechanism of the bird kidney. What limits the capacity of the bird kidney to concentrate the urine? Typically, the kidneys of birds do not concentrate the urine well when compared to those of mammals. 3) An investigation of binding of uric acid to proteins in the urine of birds. The concentration of uric acid in the urine of birds greatly exceeds the solubility limits for this compound. Crystal formation is prevented by the binding of uric acid to a protein (glycoprotein). Where does this protein come from and how does it bind uric acid? Domestic fowl (Gallus domesticus) are to be used as experimental animals to generate data to test the hypothesis of this proposal. Data generated by the proposed research will lead to a better understanding of the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance and should help to correct some of the misconceptions about avian osmoregulation.//</td><td> February 1, 1993 </td><td> IBN </td><td> The Integrative Aspects of Fluid and Electrolyte Balance in Birds</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220242.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 61 Life Science Biological </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220242</td><td> 1119 ANIMAL DEVELOPMENTAL MECHANSMS</td><td> September 30, 1996 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> California Inst of Tech\t 1201 E California Blvd\t Pasadena, CA 911250001 818/795-4571</td><td> $240000 (Estimated)</td><td> Judith Plesset \t IBN DIV OF INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY AND NEUROSCIE\t BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </td><td> a9220242</td><td> 9118,</td><td> R.

The lineages forming these territories are completely segregated from each other by the 6th cleavage and spatially restricted gene expression begins one or two divisions later.

The proposed experiments test the working hypothesis that lipoxygenase, rapidly induced upon attack by an avirulent pathogen, is required for disease resistance, and functions in the synthesis of jasmonic acid which serves to regulate the host defense response. The pathogen defense response will be tested intransgenic plants which either over-produce the lipoxygenase cDNA or in antisense plants with reduced levels of lipoxygenase activity. These experiments will provide evidence that the rapid induction of lipoxygenase upon pathogen attack is an important component of an effective host defense response. The spatial patterns of lipoxygenase mRNA, protein accumulation and gene expression will be determined in response to pathogen attack by in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry and analysis of lipoxygenase promoter/GUS fusions, respectively. Finally, the kinetics of both lipoxygenase induction and jasmonate production inresponse to pathogen attack will be measured to determine the relationship of these two species in signalling.

The specific problem addressed in this proposal is that raised by the observation that the coupling between ATP hydrolysis and proton transport by ATPases from both the plasma membrane and the tonoplast appears to be variable depending, for example, upon the concentration of anions present in the membrane vesicle suspension. Hypotheses involving intrinsic u coupling between transport and ATPase activity (\"slip\") or electrically driven passive proton fluxes (\"leak\") will be tested by a variety of methods to account for the apparent discrepancy between anion stimulation of ATPase-mediated proton fluxes and of ATPase activity. %%% A proper distribution of salts between the inside and outside of a cell and the inside and outside of individual cellular compartments is critical for the normal function of all cells. The long term goal of this research is to understand the transport mechanisms for ions such as protons, potassium, and sodium (the components of salts) across the membranes of plant cells to maintain their normal distributions. This requires understanding the properties of the individual ion transport systems. A useful overall hypothesis for the mechanism of ion transport is based on a scheme in which the primary active transport systems are enzymes that transport protons (hydrogen ions) across cell membranes against an electrochemical gradient, using energy from hydrolysis of the energy-rich molecule, ATP. According to this scheme, other ions are transported by way of secondary systems that derive their energy from the electrochemical gradient of protons. (Transport of calcium ions across the plasma membrane is an exception.) The specific goal of this project is to study in some detail the relation between ATP hydro lysis and proton transport across the plant cell outer membrane and the membrane of an intracellular compartment, the tonoplast. The results of this research should provide a fundamental piece of the puzzle that in the long run will result in a complete understanding of how plants maintain their salt balance. ***</td><td> September 1, 1993 </td><td> MCB </td><td> Coupling Between ATP Hydrolysis and H+ Transport by ATPases in the Plasma Membrane and Tonoplast of Plant Cells</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220261.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 61 Life Science Biological </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220261</td><td> 1166 MOLECULAR BIOCHEMISTRY</td><td> August 31, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> Cornell University-Endowed\t Office of Sponsored Programs\t Ithaca, NY 148532801 607/255-5014</td><td> $216926 (Estimated)</td><td> Marcia Steinberg \t MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE\t BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </td><td> a9220261</td><td> 0000,9119,9183,BIOT,OTHR,</td><td> George P.

Atyeo (Principal Investigator current)</td><td> February 9, 1995 </td><td> Feather mites are obligate commensals on or in the feathers of birds and are known to occur on every avian family except the penguins, totids, and ratites of South America and Australia. The more than 2,000 species (estimated to represent 10% of the total fauna) are assigned to 379 named and approximately 64 new genera arranged in 32 families and three superfamilies. Among these taxa there are many examples of convergent evolution of form, apparent coevoloution of hosts and commensals, and specializations for different microhabitats on and in feathers. At the present time, it is still practically impossible for non-specialists to make valid determinations even though there are many papers on feather mites. The reasons for this are simple - there are no reliable keys to families, few inclusive keys to genera and species within families, and no guides to the vast literature. In collaboration chiefly with Dr. J. Gaud (Nice, France), the leading authority of feather mites, we will rectify the lamentable situation concerning identification. We plan to produce an illustrated publication for the identification of the aforementioned supraspecific taxa. The first step is to complete illustrations of species to represent the 379 genera. These should be completed in one year. The combined 75 years of experience of Dr. J. Gaud and the principal investigator make us uniquely qualified to undertake this major project. When completed, the publication will open the field of feather mite systematics where so much basic research is needed, especially phylogenetic, biological and ontogenetic studies, and host-commensal relationships.</td><td> March 1, 1993 </td><td> DEB </td><td> Classification of the Supraspecific Taxa of Feather Mites (Acarina, Astigmata) of the World Avifauna</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220278.txt</td><td> 0202000 Atmospheric Science-ICAS 12 Chemistry </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220278</td><td> 1960 STRUCTURE AND REACTIVITY</td><td> July 31, 1996 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> William Marsh Rice Univ\t 6100 Main Street, MS-16\t Houston, TX 772511892 713/348-4820</td><td> $537600 (Estimated)</td><td> Francis J.

Recent results from the NSF-supported experiment P238, run at the CERN SPS-Collider, suggest that the UNK asymmetric collider project could be an important international facility for the study of the physics of particles which contain B or Beauty quarks and, in particular, for the study of CP violation. A team of five scientists led by Dr. Peter Schlein of UCLA will travel to Protvino in July 1992 to evaluate the status of the UNK project.

However, efforts to elucidate the group's evolutionary history using data from morphology have met with frustration; the consensus of available morphological phylogenies yields an almost total lack of resolution. This project will examine cladistic relationships in the Nymphalidae through character analysis of DNA sequences taken from independent mitochondrial and nuclear gene regions. The survey of taxa will include representatives of all nymphalid tribes (in 72 genera). This, combined with the use of multiple genetic markers, is expected to provide resolution not available from previous morphological or molecular studies. The phylogenetic results will serve as a framework for examining well-known evolutionary hypotheses including mimicry, herbivore- hostplant coevolution, and the evolution of unpalatability. %%% The butterfly family Nymphalidae contains some of the best-known species in the insect world, including the Monarch Butterfly, our national insect, and such conspicuous members of the tropical fauna as the Passion Flower butterflies (Heliconius) and the beautiful Morpho butterflies. Forms such as the Morpho are currently the focus of intense conservation research as part of urgent efforts to save the earth's biodiversity. This project will sequence DNA molecules from representative butterfly species in the family Nymphalidae and use the molecular data obtained to produce a phylogeny or description of relationships among those species.

New raised-print technology permits printing scientific equations, figures, and diagrams that can be read tactilely. Development and testing of an equation-printing method that retains the intuitive and conceptual advantages of the standard spatial representation of math equation is under development. Research to date has worked with equations comprised of braille numbers and letters and with tactile representations of the math symbols that replace the often ambiguous braille math symbols. Math equations are now presented in a spatial format as they are for sighted people, unlike that used with braille. Fractions are printed as numerator over denominator. Subscripts and superscripts are printed in the proper sub- or superscripted positions. Limits of sums and integrals are printed in their normal positions. The symbols are represented by compact tactile patterns that can be read more easily than the Braille math symbols. The process is referred to as the \"Dots+\" method. Research is being done to determine whether representation of common math symbols can be done with an enhanced 6-symbol cell with three distinguishable symbols, or if it will be necessary to use an 8-symbol cell with two symbols. Work is also being done to use the enhanced Braille cell to represent alphabetic charters, greek, italic, bold, script, etc. Non-overprinted attributes (for example, vector signs, dots, carets, tildes, and other such things over a character) are being printed normally with some enhancement for readability. The printing technology needed for producing such dot+ equations exists, but an actual machine does not. The project has been promised a beta-test version of a desk-top plotter capable of making any of the required shapes. During the project, the Director is working with two undergraduate computer science students, one of whom is blind. In addition, he is researching international activities in aspects of blind technology. The research being done should result in the ability to write equations for blind people that retain all the intuitive and conceptual advantages of visual equations.</td><td> September 15, 1992 </td><td> HRD </td><td> New Technologies for the Blind: Improving Accessibility to Science</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220324.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 21 Mathematics </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220324</td><td> 1269 STATISTICS</td><td> January 31, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Univ of Southern Maine\t 96 Falmouth St\t Portland, ME 041049300 207/780-4411</td><td> $19440 (Estimated)</td><td> Stephen M.

The similis simili gaudet principle, formulated recently after experimental work, states that similar (ionic-ionic, polar-polar, and apolar-apolar) side-chain interactions between a mutant enzyme and its substrate contribute more to the transition-state stabilization than dissimilar (ionic-polar, polar- apolar, etc.) ones. The researchers postulate that the effect can be related to electrostatic and hydrophobic enzyme-substrate complementarity. To understand the phenomenon in detail and to check the general validity of the hypothesis, the researchers intend to perform both simple empirical and sophisticated molecular dynamics calculations on various enzyme-substrate systems and analyze energy terms in order to select those which may be interpreted as determinant of the hydrophobic complementarity. The combination of the similis simili gaudet hypothesis coming from Hungary and the simulation methods developed and applied by the American side should contribute to our knowledge of enzyme-substrate interactions.

Cramer (Co-Principal Investigator current)</td><td> July 13, 1993 </td><td> Protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) is a heterodimeric enzyme that post-translationally modifies proteins by attaching an isoprenyl moiety to a C-terminal cysteine. This modification, identified in yeast and animals, is required for membrane association and in vivo activities of many regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle control and differentiation. The major focus of the proposed project is to elucidate the role(s) of FTase and protein prenylation in mediating plant developmental processes. In recent experiments, a cDNA clone encoding a pea FTase beta subunit has been cloned and characterized, protein prenylation has been demonstrated in plant cells, and FTase transcript levels have been analyzed in apical buds of pea seedlings and suspension-cultured tomato cells. In both experimental systems, a rapid, transient increase in FTase mRNA was detected preceding the onset of active cell division. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that FTase mediates the activity of critical components of the signal transduction pathways controlling cell division in plants, analogous to its key role in cell cycle control in fungal and mammalian systems. To test this hypothesis, a cDNA for the FTase alpha subunit will be cloned from pea and biochemical and physiological properties of pea FTase will be delineated using both in vitro assays and in vivo plant cells transiently expressing protein prenylation substrates. Detailed analyses of the temporal and spatial patterns of pea Ftase gene expression will be performed to provide clues as to its functional significance in plant development. Plant cells and stably transformed plants, inhibited in Ftase expression by antisense RNAs or competitive peptide inhibitor, will be monitored for phenotypic, cellular, and molecular changes to directly assess the role of FTase in regulating plant cell division and differentiation. %%% It has recently been discovered that certain proteins are modified, under some physiological conditions, by covalent attachment of isoprenyl groups to a specific C-terminal amino acid. Isoprenyl groups are a type of organic molecule that tends to be more soluble in fats or oils than in water. This modification, then, has the effect of allowing proteins that would otherwise remain dissolved in the watery cytoplasm of a cell to attach to cellular membranes. which are composed of fatty materials. It is now becoming clear that the association of particular proteins with membranes is a critical event in a chain of biochemical events that regulate cell division, membrane fusion, and a variety of other cell biological processes. This important regulatory mechanism has been described and is actively being studied in mammalian cells and in yeast, but until now nothing has been known of its possible existence or role in higher plants. This is the subject of this research. These investigators have identified the gene for one part of the enzyme that carries out addition of isoprenyl groups to proteins in peas and will use techniques of molecular biology to characterize the enzyme further and to study its possible function in plants.</td><td> August 1, 1993 </td><td> MCB </td><td> Plant Protein Farnesyltransferase: Molecular and FunctionalAnalyses</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220395.txt</td><td> 0311000 Polar Programs-Related 42 Geological Sciences </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220395</td><td> 5112 ANTARCTIC GEOLOGY & GEOPHYSICS</td><td> November 30, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> U of Nevada Las Vegas\t Office of Sponsored Programs\t Las Vegas, NV 891541037 702/895-1357</td><td> $329037 (Estimated)</td><td> Scott Borg \t OPP OFFICE OF POLAR PROGRAMS \t O/D OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR </td><td> a9220395</td><td> 0000,9178,9251,OTHR,SMET,</td><td> Margaret N.

In Brassica, SI is genetically controlled by the highly polymorphic S locus, and work in the Nasrallahs' laboratory has demonstrated that two genes are tightly linked to this locus and located within 200 kb of each other: one gene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein kinase, and the other encodes a secreted glycoprotein highly homologous to the extracellular domain of the receptor. To understand the role of S-locus genes in SI, Dr. Nasrallah has begun an analysis of self- compatible variants in two predominantly self-incompatible species, B. oleracea and B. campestris. They identified a strain carrying a mutation in a trans-acting locus that regulates in the stigma S- locus function and the expression of the secreted glycoprotein gene at the RNA level. Two other strains were identified that carry S- locus linked mutations, or\"self-fertility\" alleles, and lack transcripts encoded by the receptor kinase gene They propose to continue the molecular genetic characterization of these spontaneous variants with the aim of deciphering the role of the receptor kinase gene in SI. In addition, other self-compatible variants will be isolated from among the available genetic base in an effort to obtain additional genetic markers at the complex S- locus region, and to ascertain the number of genes that are necessary and sufficient to impart an SI response. The genetic studies will be complemented by an analysis of engineered receptor kinase mutations expected to be dominant based on studies of receptor kinase mediated signalling pathways in other systems.

Despite its economic importance surprisingly little is known about rubber biogenesis in higher plants. Rubber is produced in numerous species but mechanisms of its synthesis are poorly understood.

Our studies will protein (RPP), the most abundant protein of guayule rubber particles. The function of RPP in rubber biogenesis will be addressed because its abundance suggests that it plays an important role either in biosynthesis stabilization, solubilization or trafficking of rubber particles. Prevailing evidence suggesting that RPP is guayule RuT must be confirmed with newly available molecular probes. A cDNA clone for RPP, recently identified in the lab, will be used to elucidate its role in rubber biogenesis. Full-length RPP clones will be examined for the effect of their expression in various heterologous and homologous systems. Biochemical analysis and enzymatic assays will compare RPP expression with putative RuT and prenyl transferase activity in those systems. Partial clones of RPP expressed as fusion proteins in E. Coli will be used to generate de-glycosylated RPP Suitable for antibody production. Antisera prepared against recombinant RPP will be used several fold; first, to measure inhibition of prenyltransferase activity in in vitro assays; second, to detect for the presence of RPP- liked proteins in other rubber-producing species and finally, for immunocytochemical studies in guayule and in transgenic plants.

The search for general organizing principles and new biological processes using these data requires a starting framework for a theory of genome structure. This project continues Dr. Walsh's long-term research goal of a comprehensive population-genetic theory of genome evolution, based on an understanding of how molecular forces within the cell shape the genome and, conversely, how one can make inferences on the nature of these forces from genomic sequence and structural information. Three related problems will be examined. The first is to examine how intracellular selection, drift, and gene conversion influence the within-cell substitution dynamics of organelle genes. All eukaryotes carry at least two separate genomes (the nuclear genome plus one or two organelle --- mitochondrial and chloroplast --- genomes). Organelle genomes are very widely used as genetic markers in problems as diverse as understanding human origins, tracing the genetic input from different native plants into high-yield domesticated crops, and conservation biology. The theory proposed to be developed here will provide a better understanding of how these genetic markers behave. Second, models for the conditions under which a recently duplicated gene evolves a new function (as opposed to becoming an inactive pseudogene) will be examined. There has been essentially no modeling of just how frequent (or infrequent) the evolution of new function is expected to be. Finally, models of the evolution of genome size, treating size as a quantitative- genetic character will be developed. While there is a developing theory of the behavior of an individual gene family, there is currently no general theory about how genome size as a whole evolves. //</td><td> April 1, 1993 </td><td> DEB </td><td> Theoretical Population Genetics of Genome Evolution</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220435.txt</td><td> 0203000 Health 61 Life Science Biological </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220435</td><td> 1108 INSTRUMENTAT & INSTRUMENT DEVP</td><td> December 31, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Tuskegee University\t Tuskegee Institute, AL 36088 334/727-8501</td><td> $14768 (Estimated)</td><td> Michael K.

First, to study the fundamental properties of metallic structures with sizes below 100 nanometers. While this is considerably smaller than currently available commercial devices, structures in this size range will be of great importance in future generations of devices. It is important to understand the behavior of these structures, particularly since they will likely exhibit new properties which are not found in larger structures. Second, these structures will be used as tools in the study of fundamental phenomena. In many cases these structures can be used to probe effects which are not accessible with larger structures.

To this date transport through cells has been studied in enormous detail. Our good understanding of transcellular transport and its regulation has helped us appreciate the mechanisms of animal adaptation to fresh- and saltwater, it has led to the discovery of the molecular defect in cystic fibrosis, and it has aided the development of new drugs (diuretics). The mechanisms of transport between cells are just now beginning to receive attention. A major advance in this direction was made during the previous NSF award period in the laboratory of the PI: the first demonstration that an extracellular peptide (leucoknin, a neurohormone) regulates a transport pathway outside the cell. Whether this pathway is between cells, the so-called paracellular pathway, is the first and most important objective of the continuation of this work. The second objective is the detailed examination of the ion pump located in the cell membrane facing the urine side of the kidney.

The experimental systems to be studied are three antibody/protein complexes and four antibody/hapten complexes for which high resolution X-ray structures and binding data re available, plus data on binding differences for point amino acid mutations and hapten analogue binding. The focus will be on two key aspects: 1) The role of solvation, which involves both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. 2)'Association entropy' effects, meaning the loss of translational/rotational entropy upon association, with the concomitant gain in vibrational entropy of the complex, and the change in conformational mobility of groups involved in the intermolecular contact. A combination of theoretical approaches will be used, the aim being to develop computationally feasible yet quantitative methods for calculating both differences in binding energy, and absolute binding energies. This will enable specific questions of biological importance to be addressed, including identifying the overall driving force for binding, contributions to specificity, the role of electrostatic complementarily, whether induced fitting is important, the intrinsic antigenicity of surface groups, and the effect of amino acids mutations and substitutions on binding energies. Electrostatics will be treated using a continuum treatment of solvent with an atomic detail representation of the molecule, using the Finite Difference Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB) method. Dynamic aspects will be handled by a method which combines the FDPB method with molecular mechanics (FDPB/MD). Hydrophobic interactions will be treated using surface free energy relationships, modified to account for shape effects, calibrated on small molecule solvent transfer data. Translational and rotational entropies effects will be estimated from changes in the rotational and translational partition function upon binding. %%% The ability of an organism to produce molecules that bind specifically to certain 'target' molecules or parts of 'target' molecules, but not to other molecules, gives rise to the phenomenon of biological recognition at the molecular level. This process of molecular recognition underlies many fundamental biological processes including catalysis, gene transcription and the immune response. The design of drugs also involves creating or modifying molecules to recognize given biological target molecules. In physical terms recognition occurs because a molecule binds more tightly to its 'target' than to other molecules. It is known that the tightness of binding is determined by how much energy is released (the binding energy) when two molecules are brought together. it is also known that contributions to the binding energy come from the interaction of the two molecules with each other, the interaction of each molecule with its surroundings, especially water, and from the change in shape and mobility of each molecule upon binding. However it is not yet possible to calculate the binding energy accurately, even if the structure o the two molecules is known. This impedes both our understanding of what properties of molecules are necessary for recognition and the ability to design molecules to recognize a given target. The recognition of foreign antigens by antibodies is one of the key properties of an immune system, and one of the most studied examples of molecular recognition: The structures of at least seven antigen/antibody complexes are known at the atomic level, and their binding energies have been measured. Therefore these systems have been chosen for a detailed theoretical study of binding. The aim of the proposed research is to apply recently developed methods for simulating the behavior of molecules to the problem of calculating the different contributions to the antibody-antigen binding energy. The goal is to identify the properties of the antibodies important for tight binding and specificity, and to improve the ability to calculate binding energies.</td><td> March 15, 1993 </td><td> MCB </td><td> Theoretical Studies of Antibody-Antigen Binding</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220479.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 42 Geological Sciences </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220479</td><td> 1580 INSTRUMENTATION & FACILITIES</td><td> April 30, 1996 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Woods Hole Ocean Inst\t Woods Hole, MA 02543 508/548-1400</td><td> $246112 (Estimated)</td><td> Daniel F.

The variety of host and habitats, the worldwide occurrence of all families, and the intercontinental distribution of some genera of these fungi indicate that the relationship with arthropods is very ancient. Dr. Robert Lichtwardt of the University of Kansas seeks to understand how and when trichomycetes evolved and became geographically distributed with their arthropod hosts. Data from Australia and New Zealand suggest that some fungal taxa may have had common ancestors on Gondwana at least 70-80 million years ago. Evidence to support the Gondwanan origin of austral trichomycetes will be sought in southern South America. Studies of other gut fungi in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater arthropods may provide evidence of how long certain species have been radiating with their hosts, and the roles of dispersal and vicariance in allopatric distributions. Phylogenetic analysis of trichomycete genera will assist in understanding their evolution and biogeography, and isozyme phenotypes of cultured isolates from different geographical regions of the world will provide some information on species variability. Harpellales, whose species grow only in larval stages of aquatic insects, will be studied to see whether or not their propagules can disperse phoretically with adults.</td><td> March 1, 1993 </td><td> DEB </td><td> Evolution and Distribution of Trichomycete Gut Fungi in Arthropods</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220520.txt</td><td> 0312000 Population 64 Environmental Biology </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220520</td><td> 1174 POPULATION BIOLOGY</td><td> August 31, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> University of Idaho\t Moscow, ID 838443010 208/885-6111</td><td> $280000 (Estimated)</td><td> Mark W.

Wichman hwichman@uidaho.edu (Principal Investigator current)</td><td> March 23, 1995 </td><td> Mobile genetics sequences, or transposable elements, are ubiquitous features of mammalian genomes. They cause mutations by inactivation of genes, by changing the regulation of gene expressions, and by acting as sites for recombination which leads to chromosomal rearrangement. To understand the ways in which transposable elements affect the organisms, we need a more accurate assessment of transposition rates, and an understanding of the mechanisms by which elements within the genome interact. In this regard, it has been observed that elements compared from within a single species are generally more similar to each other than elements from two related species. This phenomenon, known as concerted evolution, suggests that elements are rapidly homogenized by some force(s) acting within a species. Concerted evolution is a common feature of transposable elements families, but is usually observed at the species level or above. This project examines a unique example of concerted evolution of transposable elements at the population level. Concerted evolution has been shown to occur in hundreds of copies of the mys retrotransposon in a single geographic population of the white- footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, near Orono, Maine. Although concerted evolution of mammalian transposable elements is generally believed to result from transposition by one or a few \"molecular drivers\", data from this population suggest that biased gene conversion may be the mechanism operating here. Furthermore, this gene conversion appears to effect only part of the mys element. The specific objectives of this project are: i) to determine the proportion of mys elements in the Maine population which have undergone concerted evolution; ii) to test the hypothesis that concerted evolution of mys within this population is due to biased gene conversion; and iii) to formulate hypotheses to explain the apparently limited region of the element undergoing gene conversion. Methods employed will include radioanalytic imaging of genomic Southern blots and DNA sequence comparisons of elements from the population of interest and orthologous elements from control populations. This study will be one of the first to examine the population biology of a mammalian transposable element. Concerted evolution in this population may well provide insight in to some previously unrecognized process by which transposable elements interact within the genome and influence the genetic basis of population adaptation to changing conditions.//</td><td> March 1, 1993 </td><td> DEB </td><td> Concerted Evolution of a Retrotransposon Within a Geographic Population</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220521.txt</td><td> 0106000 Materials Research 14 Condensed Matter Physics </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220521</td><td> 1710 CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS</td><td> January 31, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> William Marsh Rice Univ\t 6100 Main Street, MS-16\t Houston, TX 772511892 713/348-4820</td><td> $330000 (Estimated)</td><td> Jean Toulouse \t DMR DIVISION OF MATERIALS RESEARCH \t MPS DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN</td><td> a9220521</td><td> 1761,9161,AMPP,</td><td> Thomas L.

The remarkable technical explosion that has occurred in genetics in the last few years has had an enormous impact on both basic and applied aspects of the field. Tremendous strides have been made in understanding the structure of genomes from the level of DNA sequence and topology through chromosome organization and nuclear architecture. The roles genes play in whole organisms to produce unique patterns, determine sex and organize and regulate function in neural systems will be explored. The explosion in information concerning mechanisms has been paralleled by a geometric rise in the number of known genes. In a similar fashion, areas of understanding in population genetics and evolution have dramatically increased often by the application of molecular techniques to classical problems and the use of computer modeling systems. Finally, the new industry of biotechnology has been spawned by the advances in basic genetics. %%% The theme of the Congress will be \"Genetics and the Understanding of Life\". Papers will be presented on the structure, behavior, evolution, pathology and engineering of genomes al all levels of biological and phylogenetic organization.

We will use this device to measure the mechanical properties of explants of dorsal axial tissues and the forces they generate during normal convergence and extension and after experimental treatments known to affect gastrulation in whole embryos. Normal and experimentally altered cell behavior will be recorded by analyzing shapes and arrangements of fluorescein dextran-labeled cells indirectly with histology and directly with low-light fluorescence microscopy and video image processing and recording. Cytoskeletal structure under normal and experimental conditions will be evaluated with immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. The results are expected to contribute to our understanding of how cytoskeletal structures and cell behaviors generate the mechanical properties and forces driving convergence and extension of the axial mesoderm.

Several investigators at the Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope have been active in the development of a new technique called ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR) which, without cloning, gives sequence-level information about DNA nicks and subtleties of DNA structure in specific genes in total mammalian DNA. The procedure combines the use of nested oligonucleotides for specificity and exponential PCR for sensitivity. At our institute LMPCR is already being used for a number of purposes, among which are: (i) Genomic sequencing: (ii) studies on in vivo chromatin structure, including the vivo location or proteins on DNA and the effect of these proteins on DNA structure: (iii) in vivo formation and repair of chemically induced DNA adducts; and (iv) in vivo formation and repair of UV and oxygen radical- induced DNA adducts. The DNA adducts being studied are mutagenic and thus these studies are directly relevant to mutagenesis and cancer; the genomic sequencing studies are relevant to the Gerome Project; and the studies on protein footprints and chromatin structure are relevant to mammalian gene regulation and thus most disease. All of the LMPCR studies are presently limited by difficulties in quantitation. This is caused by the limited sensitivity and rage of responded of film. and by limitations in resolution between adjacent bands if alternatives to film are used. The requested equipment will enable the potential of LMPCR to be more fully reached. In addition to these novel, specific projects, the storage phosphor technology used by the PhosphorImager allows a true multiuser facility to be set up which will enhance the sensitivity, resolution, and accuracy of a great many of the standard experimental techniques such as Southern blots that are now in wide in use in virtually every laboratory at out institute . The rate limiting step, exposure of the storage phosphor screen, is done in each user's laboratory, and scanning the screen, with capture of the digitized image, only takes a few minutes on the core facility instrument. Thus, the bottleneck of current alternatives to film is eliminated and one instrument is able to service many users.</td><td> July 1, 1993 </td><td> DBI </td><td> PhosphorImager System</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220535.txt</td><td> 0203000 Health 61 Life Science Biological </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220535</td><td> 1166 MOLECULAR BIOCHEMISTRY</td><td> April 30, 1996 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> Columbia University\t 1210 Amsterdam Avenue; MC 2205\t New York, NY 10027 212/854-6851</td><td> $240000 (Estimated)</td><td> Marcia Steinberg \t MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE\t BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </td><td> a9220535</td><td> 0000,9119,9183,BIOT,OTHR,</td><td> David Shore (Principal Investigator current)</td><td> February 3, 1995 </td><td> The aim of the proposed studies is to identify amino acids involved in base-specific contacts in the yeast DNA-binding protein RAP1. The RAP1 protein is essential for viability in yeast and functions in both regulation of transcription (as either a repressor or activator) and maintenance of telomere structure. The DNA-binding domain of RAP1 (A central 250 amino acid region) has no similarity to known DNA binding motifs and thus may represent a novel class of DNA binding proteins. The proposed research builds upon a genetic selection in yeast, based on the ability of RAP1 to activate transcription, to isolate mutant proteins with altered DNA binding specificity (ABS mutants). Such mutants are identified as dominant suppressors that allow a non-consensus (mutant) binding site to function as an activation element. Mutant proteins whose function is specific to changes in only one position in the binding site will then be characterized biochemically to determine precisely their sequence specificity of binding. Inferences from initial suppression studies will be extended by alanine substitution mutagenesis of small segments of the DNA-binding domain (-10-15 amino acids) in a systematic search for \"missing contact\" mutants. Results from these experiments will be used in saturation mutagenesis experiments designed to obtain further quantitative information concerning specific amino acid- base contacts. %%% Regulation of transcription in eukaryotics is of fundamental importance in both development and in an organism's response to its environment.

The project is called Gamma-ray Astronomy at South Pole (GASP). The primary instrument consists of an array of parabolic mirrors, with photomultiplier tubes at their foci, which can detect light from VHE interactions in a small volume of the atmosphere. The experiment is expected to shed light on the origin of cosmic rays and possibly on sources of exotic radiation, if such radiation exists. GASP complements the pre-existing South Pole Air Shower Experiment (SPASE), which is operated by the Bartol Research Institute of the University of Delaware and Leeds University (UK), and extends downward by two to three orders of magnitude the energy threshold of SPASE. SPASE can survey most of the southern sky, and GASP will be able to focus on small regions of suspected activity. The location at South Pole allows GASP to view a single object for extended periods (weeks to months) through a constant thickness of atmosphere, while mid-latitude locations allow only a few hours of viewing at a time of a given object.

Located near the Black Warrior River in Alabama this site marks one of the highest cultural achievements of pre- Columbian Native Americans. It consists of a large number of mounds arranged in roughly symmetrical order, many containing tens of thousands of cubic meters of fill. Archaeological evidence indicates that these structures, which were likely built over extended periods of time contained religious structures at their tops and also served as burial chambers. Several have yielded large series of skeletons and burial goods. Of central importance is not the structures themselves but the nature of the social organization which made them possible. To construct such massive earthworks requires a social and political organization which can mobilize a large amount of labor for long periods of time. Dr. Knight's research should provide insight into this underlying social structure. Building on past work at the site Dr. Knight will conduct two seasons of excavation. Using standard archaeological techniques he will cut trenches into a number of mounds. The materials collected will allow him to date the construction (or multiple construction episodes) of each. On this basis estimates of person power over time can also be made. Dr. Knight will attempt to determine the functions of each structure and how these also may have changed over time. This research is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to many scientists.

Johnson (Co-Principal Investigator current)</td><td> February 18, 1993 </td><td> The tobacco, human and two Arabidopsis genes for a highly conserved eukaryotic ribosomal protein (CEP52) contain introns. In each gene, one intron contains open reading frame which would allow the production of an altered form of the CEp52 protein (ALT52) from unspliced message. Based on immunoblots probed with CEP52 specific antiserum, it is proposed that translation of unspliced mRNA occurs. A putative ALT52 is expressed at high levels in rat tissues, but the protein is not ribosomally associated. ALT52 synthesis appears to be tissue specific and inversely related to the level of CEP52 present. Since CEP52 levels correspond to the amount of ribosomes present in rat tissues, the production of ALT52 may function to limit ribosomes production. These preliminary results suggests that CEP52 splicing may be a novel regulatory mechanism involved in controlling the levels of cytoplasmic ribosomes. The investigators will investigate these observations by characterizing the rat proteins that react with the CEP52 antibody and by sequencing a rat CEP52 genomic clone to determine if the gene contains introns as do the other characterized CEP52 genes. Additional antibodies will be generated to examine the possible production of ALT52 in the plant Arabidopsis. %%% Cellular ribosome levels are controlled by the need for the proteins that they synthesize. Rapidly growing cells, whether normal or cancerous, require elevated amounts of ribosomes compared to cells that are not as metabolically active. Despite significant advances, gaps remain in our understanding of how the assembly of two ribosomes from more that 80 proteins and four nucleic acids is coordinated and regulated. Two ribosomal proteins discovered in 1989 may have important roles in the regulation of ribosome assembly, since, an insufficient amount of either protein results in the decreased production of functional ribosomes. Recent studies suggest that one of these proteins may be regulated by editing the RNA copy of the genetic information once it is transcribed from DNA. This editing process occurs for many proteins, however, this case is unusual in that both the edited and unedited form of the RNA could be used to produce a protein. The proteins would be identical in some parts of their structure, but would significantly differ in size and probably function Preliminary evidence indicates that two forms of this protein are produced. The large version that would be produced from the unedited RNA is not found on ribosomes, and it is produced in the largest amounts by tissues that have few ribosomes. These studies will determine if the detected proteins are produced as the result of RNA editing of a common RNA precursor and if the editing process represents a previously unknown regulatory mechanism that controls ribosome levels.</td><td> March 15, 1993 </td><td> MCB </td><td> A Novel Mechanism of Ribosomal Protein Modulation</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220577.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 61 Life Science Biological </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220577</td><td> 1156 MICROBIAL GENETICS</td><td> January 31, 1998 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> U of Washington\t 3935 University Way NE\t Seattle, WA 981056613 206/543-4043</td><td> $285000 (Estimated)</td><td> Philip Harriman \t MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE\t BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </td><td> a9220577</td><td> 9119,9183,BIOT,</td><td> David R.

They are often raised artificially for mass release in agricultural areas where they can serve as important agents of biological control. Henry et. al. have found that several distinct North American species of green lacewings exist which can be told apart only by their unique courtship songs. Similar-looking lacewings are found in Europe, but these have songs that differ greatly from North American ones and vary from region to region. In the past, all of these European and North American lacewings have been thought of interchangeably as a single species, Chrysoperla carnea, and have been freely exported and imported across the Atlantic for biological control purposes. However, since different species can show strong prey preferences and other individualistic behaviors, it is feasible that some mass reared and released green lacewings might be relatively ineffective against certain targeted pest species. Efforts at biological control should be enhanced by recognizing the hidden biodiversity within this lacewing species complex and beginning to use the most appropriate \"song species\" in each continent, area or habitat. %%% This project will investigate the hidden species diversity in European green lacewings using song analysis, just as has been done for the North American ones. Thus, the investigators will determine how many true species exist in this economically important insect group and which are appropriate for use in biological pest control programs in different areas of the world.

The term 'reaction norm' refers to the responses of an organism (actual and potential) to environmental variation. The nature of these responses to the environment is under genetic control, and there are several ways that control can be manifested. The form of the genetic control is important because it will determine whether selection, either in the wild or in agriculture, can alter the ways that plants respond to changes in environmental factors such as light, water, nutrients or herbivores. The experiments being undertaken will reveal the genetic components of response to a gradient in soil nutrients, using a model plant system, Arabidopsis thaliana.

The results of these two sets of experiments will provide a better understanding of the genetic determination of reaction norms, and of how selection may operate to change reaction norms.

The temporal and spatial regulation off host factors during initial host-pathogen interactions is conditioned by host recognition of viral/viroid signals and the subsequent transduction of the signal leading to metabolic alterations. The processes by which these agents manipulate host plant proteins are unknown. Protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cascades are important post- translational processes which serve to rapidly amplify and transduce specific developmental and environmental signals and coordinate metabolic responses. This laboratory has characterized a plant-encoded protein kinase (p68) whose autophosphorylation is induced in viral and viroid infected plants and in noninfected tissue extracts supplemented with viral dsRNA and artificial dsRNA. The response is signal dependent and occurs in the initial phases of pathogenesis. Studies to date have emphasized biochemical and immunological characterization of p68. In order to better understand the role of p68 it is necessary to begin analysis at the gene level. The investigator has chosen to use both virus- and viroid-host models. Each has distinct attributes. This project will further characterize the significance of p68 activity in host- pathogen interactions and in healthy plants by isolating, sequencing and studying the cDNA and genomic clones of p68. The functional significance also may be indicated by determining the phosphorylation of p68 in tissues challenged with viroid mutants which vary in both RNA stability and pathogenicity. The role of p68 may also be indicated by expression of sense and antisense constructs in transgenic plants. p68 appears to be the only plant protein thus far described that is associated with dsRNA dependent protein kinase activity. The viral/viroid-plant systems are excellent models to define the significance of phosphorylation in host-pathogen interactions as well as to study the role of phosphorylation in healthy plants and how that function is altered during infection. %%% Addition or removal of phosphate groups (phosphorylation, dephosphorylation) from specific proteins plays an important role in the recognition and amplification of environmental and biological signals in all organisms. This process may also have a central role in the way plants perceive and respond to signals generated during attack by pathogens or wounding. The goal of this research is to determine the role of protein phosphorylation in virus-plant interactions. It will focus on a specific protein, \"p68\", that catalyzes the addition of phosphate to itself in the presence of double stranded RNA from plant viruses. The role of p68 in normal plant physiology and during viral infection will be studied. The processes by which viruses manipulate normal proteins after they infect plants are largely unknown. The results of this research should be an important contribution to basic understanding of how plants respond to viruses.</td><td> April 15, 1993 </td><td> MCB </td><td> Plant Viral and Viroid Induced dsRNA-Dependent Kinase Activity</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220619.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 64 Environmental Biology </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220619</td><td> 1171 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY</td><td> February 29, 1996 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> University of Michigan\t 3003 S State St. RM 1062\t Ann Arbor, MI 481091274 313/764-1817</td><td> $129924 (Estimated)</td><td> \t DEB DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY \t BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </td><td> a9220619</td><td> </td><td> Miriam L.

Recent advances in methods for quantifying shape change have yielded promising techniques that will be applied in this analysis. The method of thin-plate splines, the method that I propose to use, has a unique advantage in that it gives a way to identify a series of independent shape characters that have specific location and spatial extent on the skull. In the first stage of this project, I will compare three genera of murid rodent Mus, Sigmodon and Peromyscus. Relationships among these genera are not controversial. I will compare: 1) transformations in skull shape from age to age in each species; 2) average skull shape at each age across species; and 3) intraspecific variability of skull shapes and their transformations. This phase of the research will explore several methodological issues, such as methods for coding developmental transformations of shape characters.

Recently, there has been an increase in forest regeneration in this region. This study is designed to gather field data from a variety of sites that will be used to parameterize a model of forest development based on actual starting conditions measured in the field. Forest dynamics is a function of seed dispersal, seedling establishment, and differential growth rates of component species. In this study field experiments will be conducted in a range of forest habitats to determine the role of seed dispersal and herbivory in effecting forest regeneration. The results from these experiments will be used to adjust and improve the forest dynamics model called SORTIE. Models such as SORTIE provide baseline data under known conditions against which it will be possible to compare actual patterns of forest regeneration. The mechanisms associated with the model will dramatically increase our ability to predict changes in forest vegetation. The ability to predict changes will have important implications for global climate change and its effects on future biodiversity. %%% Previous approaches to modelling forest dynamics have relied exclusively on average response variables and average environmental conditions. The SORTIE model represents a vast improvement over earlier models because it is truly spatially explicit. Initial conditions will be derived from positions of individual trees and saplings measured in the field. In addition, the actual environmental conditions in different stands will be measured and incorporated into the model. The role of herbivores in forest regeneration is being measured and added to the model.

Two of the species (H.garnotti and Lepidodactylus lugubris) being replaced reproduce parthenogenetically.

This research develops a theory regarding the utility of social laws in a computational environment, laws which guarantee successful coexistence of multiple programs and programmers. It focuses on the coordination of activities of computer agents, but the investigations will be guided by, and impact, coordination in societies which involve humans as well. A number of approaches to activity coordination have been discussed in the literature; this research concentrates on one approach which, although very commonsensical, has received relatively little attention in the computer science community. Roughly speaking, the approach is as follows. The society will adopt a set of social laws; each agent will be required to obey these laws, and will be able to assume that all others will as well. These laws will on the one hand constrain the plans available to the agent, but on the other hand will guarantee certain behaviors on the part of other agents. The domain of traffic laws for mobile robots illustrates the point: Rather than install a centralized controller (the most common approach in robotics today), or have the robots continually negotiate in order to avoid collisions (the spirit of which is representative of much work in distributed AI), this approach will have robots obey traffic laws such as \"keep to the right of the road\". Again, although very commonsensical, this approach has not been developed in a systematic fashion; as we shall see, it poses some highly nontrivial problems. One part of the proposed research is concerned with the off line design of social laws, along the lines mentioned in the previous paragraph. Another part is concerned with the on line evolution of social conventions: even when we as designers are not in a position to impose social laws ahead of time, we will want to design the agents in a way which will encourage the evolution of conventions over time. In service of these goals, the following is proposed: (1) define precise models for multi agent systems, in which social laws are explicitly represented; (2) define and investigate the basic computational problems involved in off line synthesis of useful social laws; (3) implement the idea of social laws for artificial agent societies in the framework of particular domains of application, while still proving analytical results about the usefulness of these laws in those domains; (4) investigate the evolution of social conventions in a computational framework. More specifically, understand how different parameters (such as memory and communication) affect the efficiency of convention evolution; and (5) investigate the interaction between social structure (such as authority hierarchies) and social laws. h) 0*0*0*</td><td> September 1, 1993 </td><td> IIS </td><td> Social Laws for Artificial Agent Societies</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220647.txt</td><td> 0203000 Health 61 Life Science Biological </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220647</td><td> 1132 CELLULAR ORGANIZATION</td><td> August 31, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> Univ of Connecticut\t 14 Dog Lane\t Storrs, CT 062694133 203/486-2000</td><td> $276988 (Estimated)</td><td> Barbara K.

This is an important aspect of these organisms' central role in the mineralization processes which so many \"higher\" forms of life are unable to effect, but upon which they are dependent. The mechanism by which the gliding bacteria accomplish this translocation remains a mystery; however, the sulfonolipids first isolated and described in this laboratory are the first molecules to be recognized as necessary (in the cytophagas an flexibacters) for gliding motility. A cell-surface polysaccharide also plays an accessory role. The current focus on the features of the cell envelope that are important in cell translocation will include a peptidoglycan-associated protein and other cell envelope features that change when a particular nongliding mutant regains, reversibly, the ability to glide. %%% The question of how gliding bacteria glide has been one of the most intractable problems in microbiology. There are no morphological clues to the mechanism of gliding. A number of laboratories have been working on the problem for many years, using both genetic and biochemical approaches, with minimal success. The Leadbetter laboratory made a breakthrough discovery when it was found that a particular nongliding mutant of Cytophaga johnsonae had a defect in the pathway of biosynthesis of a novel sulfonolipid, and that the nongliding phenotype could be reversed by the addition of the appropriate metabolic precursor (cysteate) to the culture medium. This project is a biochemical followup to that seminal discovery, and holds the promise of actually deciphering the nature of the bacterial molecule(s) involved in the gliding mechanism.</td><td> March 1, 1993 </td><td> MCB </td><td> Envelope Components of Gliding Bacteria</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220652.txt</td><td> 0312000 Population 64 Environmental Biology </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220652</td><td> 1174 POPULATION BIOLOGY</td><td> September 30, 1996 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> University of Rochester\t Rochester, NY 14627 585/275-4031</td><td> $240000 (Estimated)</td><td> Mark W.

In particular, the control strategy is aimed at deliberate releases from man-made storage or process facilities that are deemed unavoidable because alternative actions may lead to more severe catastrophic results. The procedure consists of combining two-dimensional transient models that simulate the dynamics of the release and its subsequent fate in the environment and an adaptive control scheme, which monitors the current state of the released matter and the ambient conditions. Real-time feedback is sent to the control mechanism, which in turn develops an optimum release strategy that minimizes a predetermined performance index. The simulation models that are employed for the direct solution of the release spreading have been repeatedly verified for their accuracy and reliability and standard optimization techniques have shown that control of water and toxic releases is possible. The novelty of the proposed research lies in an alternative formulation of the control problem that avoids iterative simulations of the direct problem, which, due to lengthy computations, hinder the real-time implementation of the procedure. In contrast, by solution of the adjoint equation for a variety of evolution problems described by an enlarging and deforming domain, it is possible to optimize a given performance index without repeated simulations. The result is an efficient and practical procedure for unavoidable hazardous releases that can minimize their environmental impact.</td><td> May 15, 1993 </td><td> CMS </td><td> Adaptive Control of Unavoidable Hazardous Releases</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220665.txt</td><td> 0208000 Water Resources 64 Environmental Biology </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220665</td><td> 1182 ECOLOGY</td><td> September 30, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Rutgers Univ New Brunswick\t ASB III, 3 Rutgers Plaza\t New Brunswick, NJ 08901 732/932-0150</td><td> $123968 (Estimated)</td><td> Scott Collins \t DEB DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY \t BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </td><td> a9220665</td><td> </td><td> Peter J.

Dr. Thomas Dowling of Arizona State University has been studying genetic interactions between these two hybridizing species, and he has identified geographic variation in the effectiveness of factors maintaining reproductive discontinuity. This study expands upon Dr. Dowling's previous research by examining eastern locations where the two species co-occur and adjacent areas to the west and south, providing complete characterization of geographic variation in reproductive isolation. Sequence variation of the mitochondrial DNA control region is being used to infer phylogenetic relationships of cornutus and chrysocephalus populations and identify the importance of pre- and post-Pleistocene effects in structuring of genetic variation within these species. Comparisons of these relationships with the pattern of reproductive isolation will allow for tests of the role of ancestry, dispersal, and geological history in geographic variation of reproductive isolation.

These studies examine both the dynamics of the nuclear reactions and the degrees of freedom required to describe the structure of the nuclear states. The major emphasis of the program will involve studies of electromagnetic processes. In particular with the expected completion of CEBAF accelerator in 1994, much of the effort will be directed toward the experiments associated with the CEBAF. An additional project involves the construction of a recoil neutron polarimeter (HARP) which will be used at NIKHEF and CEBAF. The proposed experiments, at CEBAF as well as NIKHEF and MIT-Bates, address physics questions ranging from the determination of nuclear structure functions to nucleon-nucleon correlations in nuclei to the underlying quark structure of baryon resonances. An experiment at even higher energy to measure J/Psi production in nuclei is being contemplated. Hadron-induced studies at other facilities will tend to emphasize the measurement of polarization observable, either with polarized incident particles, polarized nuclear targets, or both. Such measurements provide additional constraints and information on the medium corrections to the interactions and the role of relativity in the processes. //</td><td> February 15, 1993 </td><td> PHY </td><td> Experimental Nuclear Physics Research Program</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220691.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 42 Geological Sciences </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220691</td><td> 1580 INSTRUMENTATION & FACILITIES</td><td> September 30, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Lehigh University\t Alumni Building 27\t Bethlehem, PA 180153005 215/861-3000</td><td> $135000 (Estimated)</td><td> Daniel F.

Oster goster@nature.berkeley.edu (Principal Investigator current)</td><td> May 7, 1997 </td><td> The investigator and his colleague study by mathematical modeling and computer simulation several phenomena dealing with the mechanochemistry of cell and organelle motions. In particular, they focus on the role of biased random motions in creating order at two levels of organization. At the cell/tissue level they investigate how apparently random cell motions can self organize into tissue geometries via boundary inhibitions and intercellular communication. At the molecular/cell level they examine several intracellular motility phenomena that appear to extract work from random thermal motions by employing chemical bond energy to ratchet molecular assembly and disassembly. This study aims at basic questions about how cells move and change shape during morphogenesis, and how macromolecules are transported across cell membranes. The issues are important for fundamental understanding, and also have implications for such problems as wound healing and the development of tissues. During and after protein synthesis on ribosomes the nascent polypeptide chains must be transported across internal membranes into intracellular compartments such as endoplasmic reticula and mitochondria. How this is accomplished is a mystery, for it appears to proceed in the absence of a metabolic energy source such as nucleotide hydrolysis. The investigators propose a mechanism to explain this process based on the idea that the thermal motions of the amino acid chain can be biased by any process that makes it difficult for the chain to go backwards. Examples of such processes are binding of chaperonins, glycosylation, and/or chain folding. The propulsion mechanism of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is another example of a process that works, they believe, by ratcheted Brownian motion. This bacterium drives itself by building a tail of cross-linked actin filaments. They propose to model this process by simulating the coupled dynamics of tail assembly and the Brownian motion of the bacterium.</td><td> June 1, 1993 </td><td> DMS </td><td> Mathematical Sciences: Mathematical Models in Cellular & Developmental Biology</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220722.txt</td><td> 0203000 Health 61 Life Science Biological </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220722</td><td> 1136 SIGNAL TRANSDCTN/CELL REGULATN</td><td> November 30, 1993 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Fed of Amer Soc Exp Biol\t Bethesda, MD 20814 / -</td><td> $5000 (Estimated)</td><td> Eve Ida Barak \t MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE\t BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </td><td> a9220722</td><td> 9119,</td><td> Laurie H.

Werth CNCRW@TTACS1.TTU.EDU (Principal Investigator current)</td><td> January 16, 1996 </td><td> Hybridization between different species is an accident of nature that may in some instances have a very important outcome: the origin of new species. Hybrids are typically unable to reproduce through ordinary sexual means because they contain incompatible chromosomes that do not pair during meiosis, the reduction division that produces the haploid cells that ultimately produce eggs and sperms. However, a second accident, chromosome doubling (polyploidy) may restore fertility by providing each chromosome with an exact duplicate with which it can pair. These two processes, hybridization and polyploidy, have combined in this way to produce a vast number of new plant species, termed allopolyploids. Allopolyploids include some of our most important crops, among them wheat, cotton, coffee, peanut, and tobacco. Nonetheless, surprisingly little is known about the precise cellular mechanisms that operate to produce allopolyploids, or about the circumstances that prevail in nature when successful allopolyploids become established. The present proposal is designed to bolster our knowledge of the origin of allopolyploids through detailed studies of natural hybrids between species of Dryopteris, a genus of ferns common in eastern North America. Dryopteris is an ideal model system for the following reasons: (1) as a fern, the products of meiosis in Dryopteris are spores that can be grown directly into plants rather than the pollen grains or embryo sacs of flowering plants which are much less amenable to further study; (2) Dryopteris plants are large and produce numerous spores, offering an enhanced opportunity to observe relatively rare events; (3) numerous hybrids are produce in nature, some of them very frequently, allowing for the variation between processes that pertain to individual kinds of hybrids to be evaluated. This study will consist of two phases, a laboratory phase and a field phase. In the laboratory, the production of spores with doubled chromosomes will be followed. Such spores are believed to be distinguishable as large spherical (\"giant\") spores that stand out from the remainder of the shriveled spores ordinarily produced by the hybrid. The genetic constitution and growth potential of these \"giant\" spores will be evaluated by growing them into juvenile ferns (gametophytes) and examining these using molecular and microscopic techniques. Attempts will also be made to produce adult ferns (sporophytes) from the gametophytes by both sexual and asexual means. In the field, clusters of hybrids will be studied to determine whether they are actually reproducing through polyploid spores, i.e. whether the hybrids are all first generation, or include some later generations. Molecular fingerprinting techniques will be used that can distinguish between these two possibilities. The results from these combined field and laboratory studies will provide important new information on the means by which hybrids can give rise to allopolyploid species.</td><td> March 1, 1993 </td><td> DEB </td><td> Evolution in Dryopteris: The Role of Hybrids in Polyploid Speciation</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220759.txt</td><td> 0510102 Role-Terrestrial Ecosystem 0521400 Plant Productivity 61 Life Science Biological </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220759</td><td> 1148 ECOLOGICAL & EVOLUTIONARY PHYS</td><td> August 31, 1996 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> U of Missouri Saint Louis\t 8001 Natural Bridge Road\t Saint Louis, MO 631214499 314/516-5897</td><td> $193504 (Estimated)</td><td> \t IBN DIV OF INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY AND NEUROSCIE\t BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </td><td> a9220759</td><td> 9169,9178,9232,EGCH,ENVI,SMET,</td><td> Stephen S.

Lifespan, mass per area, nitrogen concentration, area per plant mass, area-based construction costs, and assimilation capacity of leaves will be examined as determinants of productivity (relative growth rate) during the dry season and wet season in Panama. These features have been hypothesized to be mutually supporting, interdependent, and casually interrelated. Variation in leaf features will be documented over light gradients within the canopies of mature evergreen tropical species, and among seedlings of these species in an experimental common garden with a factorial design of contrasting levels of light and water. These species encompass considerable variation in leaf longevity, while producing new leaves in seasons of contrasting water and light availability. As such they allow the examination of specific predictions about how functional characters vary in response to variation in the opportunity for carbon gain. Studies will be conducted at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) using a construction crane for access to the canopy of a tropical dry forest. Garden treatments and canopy trees will be followed for three years. These will be the first comprehensive data for within-canopy physiological variation, and the first comparison of seedlings and canopy trees for leaf longevity and function in tropical species. These studies will demonstrate the potential for selection to produce coordinated responses among leaf characters to short-term and long-term variation in resources. If functional relationships among these features prove to be tightly coordinated, such physiological syndromes will provide an empirical link between leaf and whole-plant processes of growth and reproduction. The canopies of tropical trees provide some of the steepest resource gradients known with respect to light, humidity, leaf water, and possibly nutrient, and thus are a model system to assess the relationships among functional characteristics. Because of the great concern over tropical deforestation, there is a pressing need to understand physiological syndromes associated with species capable of rapid regeneration.</td><td> March 1, 1993 </td><td> IBN </td><td> Coordination of Leaf Physiology and Morphology with Variations in Resources Available to Two Neotropical Tree Species</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220761.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 64 Environmental Biology </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220761</td><td> 1171 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY</td><td> November 30, 1996 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> U of Minnesota-Twin Cities\t 450 University Gateway\t Minneapolis, MN 554151226 612/625-5000</td><td> $150000 (Estimated)</td><td> \t DEB DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY \t BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </td><td> a9220761</td><td> 9104,9178,9229,</td><td> Larry D.

Hydrangeaceae are positioned near the divergence of the subclass Asteridae, and this investigation will increase our understanding of evolutionary diversification preceding the origin of subclass Asteridae with its great floral conservation. The proposed investigation has three facets: 1. phylogenetic analysis using anatomical and morphological features of plants of the hydrangea and dogwood groups positioned taxonomically among Rosidae and near the origin of Asteridae; 2. phylogenetic analysis within the Hydrangeaceae family to distinguish natural groups of species and genera and to explore patterns of flower and fruit evolution in the family; and 3. ontogenetic or developmental studies to determine roles of various cellular processes in the evolution of different floral and fruit forms.

Exposure to chronic cold has required adaptations to overcome thermal sensitivities of cellular processes and to permit retention of characteristics that would be lethal at warmer body temperatures. Such features will be addressed in this project which focuses on a hemoglobinless icefish family. Although it is well established that these icefishes lack hemoglobin, the presence/absence of the intracellular respiratory pigment, myoglobin has not been resolved as a familial characteristic. Preliminary evidence is presented that suggests myoglobin is expressed exclusively in one tissue of a single icefish species. Validity of this conclusion will be tested using immunological methods to establish definitively whether myoglobin is expressed in oxidative muscles of channichthyid species. It will also be determined whether point mutations in the protein encoding sequence of the myoglobin gene account for lack of the protein's expression mRNA in tissues that do/do not express myoglobin. Characteristics in protein structure that are necessary for function of the intracellular fatty acid binding protein at cold cell temperatures will be examined; this protein enhances transcellular movement of metabolically important fatty acids and serves a cytoprotectant function. Coordinated ultrastructural and biochemical measurements of icefish glycolytic muscle will identify adaptations that have occurred in the tissues of icefish. These experiments will test the proposed paradigm that adaptations to overcome diffusional limitations are fundamental to ensure life at cold cellular temperatures.

The focus of this research project is on the development of strategies that have provable properties, operate in real-time, and rely on efficiently-computable, qualitative visual information to control the motion of the robot. Because the robot moves in the environment in a continuous fashion, exploration and path planning is modeled as continuous, dynamic processes where motion planning and visual sensing are tightly coupled and occur simultaneously. The connection between these two processes becomes stronger as the geometric constraints imposed on the environment's obstacles get weaker. At some level of uncertainty, this connection induces a qualitative jump in the complexity of path planning, making visual exploration of the environment's obstacles necessary. To address these problems, the dynamics of the boundary separating the explored from the unexplored parts of the environment are studied. The strategies developed aim to structure the motion of the robot so that the representation of this boundary is simple and qualitative, can be efficiently derived from qualitative visual information, and its dynamic evolution is predictable and can be used to further guide the motion of the robot. This research should provide a better understanding of the connection between motion planning in three dimensions and visual sensing, and lead to the development of active, exploratory strategies for problems such as reaching a desired location, surveying unknown environments (e.g., a ship wreck),recognizing objects, or learning the shape of an unknown object.</td><td> April 15, 1993 </td><td> IIS </td><td> Purposive Vision in Robot Exploration of Three-Dimensional Scenes</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220784.txt</td><td> 0312000 Population 64 Environmental Biology </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220784</td><td> 1174 POPULATION BIOLOGY</td><td> August 31, 1994 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Cleveland State University\t East 24th and Euclid Ave\t Cleveland, OH 44115 216/687-2000</td><td> $25000 (Estimated)</td><td> Mark W.

Conjugation is a rejuvenating event that initiates a new life cycle. This research combines field and laboratory studies of conjugation and multiple mating types in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. This species, which has seven mating types, is widely used in molecular biology but its ecology is poorly known. We will test two hypotheses: first, that conjugation occurs frequently in natural populations, and second, that the frequencies of the mating types are determined by both genotype and by the temperature of the environment.

The reactions can alter the density of the solution by releasing heat (decrease the density) and by changing the composition of the solution (either increase or decrease the density). Under the influence of gravity the resulting density gradients can result in fluid motion, or natural convection. The effect of convection on the rate of front propagation in the iron-nitric acid system has been shown to exhibit puzzling dependence on the orientation of the tube and the initial concentrations. The mechanism of the convection is still not clear. Besides raising basic questions about the interactions of chemistry and hydrodynamics, this work may aid in understanding chemically induced convection in other areas such as directional solidification and wet chemical etching. This study will measure the concentration gradients and thermal gradients in traveling fronts using video imaging technology in order to test mechanisms proposed for the convection which has been observed, and often, only inferred from measurements of propagation. Chemically induced convection systems offer insight into natural convection in small containers. The orientation dependence of fluid flow with respect to the gravitational vector is especially relevant to materials processing in space, where there is reduced gravity but greater difficulty in controlling the orientation of the container with respect to the gravitational vector.

They will analyze the high order corrections with the help of renormalization group methods, and explore many experimental consequences. On the issue of spin-charge separation, they will address the importance of non-scaling contributions, and the question of a minimal model.

The objective of their research is to develop optimal control algorithms for constrained mechanical systems, numerical methods and solutions for differential equations, and a computer environment employing symbolic, graphic and numerical software. Differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), which the investigators will utilize in their research, are found to be extremely useful for expressing and modeling optimal control of mechnical systems. DAEs have advantages over ordinary differential equations in that one can easily vary design parameters in an implicit model, a particular system structure can be better exploited, and less mathematical expertise is required on the part of the designer. The proposed research in numerical solution of DAEs is important for work in singular systems, which appear, for example, in circuits and power systems. Research results may include new and more efficient algorithms and design procedures that are applicable to a wide variety of engineering systems. The project takes advantage of the complementary background of the U.S. and French investigators in many different areas, including control and mechanics, numerical solutions of DAES, and computer software. ***</td><td> August 1, 1993 </td><td> INT </td><td> US-France Cooperative Research (INRIA): Simulation and Control of Constrained Mechanical Systems</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220803.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 13 Physics </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220803</td><td> 5979 CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE PROGR</td><td> January 15, 1996 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Slovak Acad Sci Inst Exper\t Solovjevova 47 04353 Kosice\t , 00000 / -</td><td> $0 (Estimated)</td><td> Bonnie Thompson \t INT Office of Internatl Science &Engineering\t SBE DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE</td><td> a9220803</td><td> </td><td> Karel Kudela (Principal Investigator current)</td><td> January 8, 1993 </td><td> This U.S.-Czechoslovakia Joint Fund Research on \"Energetic Particles Inside and Outside the Magnetosphere\" is between Dr. Karel Kudela of the Institute of Experimental Physics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, and Drs.

Impedance imaging systems apply current to the surface of a body, measure the induced voltages on the surface, and from this information, reconstruct an approximation to the electrical conductivity and/or electrical permittivity in the interior. Mathematically, the problem is ill- posed and nonlinear, and a frequently used approximation reduces to a Radon transform. Integral geometry is the mathematical basis for tomography and one model for impedance imaging. The Radon transform on lines is the model of X-ray tomography and generalizations model emission tomography and problems in ultrasound. Tomographers use integral geometric theorems, such as inversion formulas and range characterizations, to create and improve reconstruction methods. This project will support the AMS-SIAM Summer Seminar in Applied Mathematics on the Mathematics of Tomography, Impedance Imaging, and Integral Geometry to be held June 7-18, 1993 at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, MA. One of the features of tomography is the strong relationship between high level mathematics (such as harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, microlocal analysis, and Lie group theory) and applications to medical imaging, impedance imaging, radiotherapy, and industrial non-destructive evaluation. The conference has the following main goals: (1) to give researchers in the field the opportunity to define and articulate the main problems of current interest and to isolate common themes and approaches and (2) to strengthen the connection between the pure and applied aspects of these areas and to facilitate dialogue between researchers in the various areas.

The microbiota accomplish this regulation by a combination of intensive decomposition of dissolved organic carbon to CO2 and methane and by burying a significant portion of microbial biomass that does not decompose. High metabolism and growth results from intensive recycling of nutrients within the communities. The research program will examine natural communities under replicated experimental conditions for: (1) Metabolic and community carbon retention and decomposition to CO2 and methane in response to substratum. (2) Resistance to nutrient limitations of phosphorus and nitrogen and the effects on carbon losses. (3) Effects of different types of dissolved organic compounds on metabolic recycling and carbon losses.

Maloney (Principal Investigator current)</td><td> April 6, 1995 </td><td> This project concerns OxlT, a novel transport protein in Oxalobacter formigenes, a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium. OxlT catalyzes the exchange of external divalent oxalate for internal monovalent formate. This electrogenic exchange, along with proton consumption during intracellular decarboxylation, constitutes an indirect proton pump that generates a proton-motive force as the cell extracts \"metabolic energy\" from oxalate. It appears that this pattern is replicated by other reactions in other cells, and that indirect proton pumps may be common in microbiology. To understand this event at the molecular level, we propose to study OxlT, the antiport protein. Presently, we have methods to purify and reconstitute OxlT, and we have raised anti-OxlT polyclonal antibodies that will aid us in cloning the oxlT gene. With purified protein and a cloned gene, we will raise peptide-specific antibodies and construct gene fusions to aid in the determination of transport protein structure. Site-directed mutagenesis will be used to further characterize the structure/function properties of the enzyme together with biochemical and biophysical methods to determine the minimal functional unit (monomeric or dimeric), .- helical content and the binding properties of the protein. %%% We have shown that the microorganism, Oxalobacter formigenes, has a novel mechanism to harvest energy from its environment. This cell uses a specific membrane protein, termed OxlT, to bring divalent oxalate molecules into the cell in exchange for monovalent formate, which is simultaneously pumped out of the cell. The formate, which is required to complete the exchange cycle is generated by degradation of oxalate after the molecule is brought into the cell. The asymmetric exchange of negatively charged ions results in the formation of a membrane potential across the cell membrane, that the cell can then use to make additional energy and grow. At the heart of this new mechanism of energy formation is the membrane protein, OxlT. We will use the tools of molecular biology (cloning, mutagenesis), immunology (specific antibodies). biochemistry (purification and reconstitution) and biophysics (spectroscopy) to study the structural and functional properties of the enzyme to help us understand how such an unusual membrane \"pump\" protein, such as this one, operates to provide extra energy for the cells.</td><td> March 15, 1993 </td><td> MCB </td><td> Anion Exchange Mechanisms in Bacteria</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220828.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 81 Anthropology </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220828</td><td> 1391 ARCHAEOLOGY</td><td> August 31, 1999 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> U of Pennsylvania\t Research Services\t Philadelphia, PA 191046205 215/898-7293</td><td> $124314 (Estimated)</td><td> John E.

They will collaborate with Professor Alain Tuffreau and his team who have worked at this site for several years. Excavation to date indicates multiple archaeological levels, the lowest of which is the focus of this project. It contains materials from the Acheulian culture as well as associated faunal remains. Geological evidence indicates it dates to more than 700,000 years ago and the distribution of materials and the nature of the matrix within which they are contained suggest it may represent a living floor. Dr. Dibble and team will attempt to determine whether this, in fact, is correct. In the course of their excavation, they will apply a number of techniques which have never been used before in tandem in the excavation of such a site. All artifact orientations and distributions will be noted; a concerted effort will be made to recover very small remains; lithic artifacts and bone will be refit; fauna will be studied from a taphonomic perspective and sediment magnetic measurements will be made. On this basis the investigators hope to determine the extent of post depositional disturbance. The archaeological meaning of the materials can then be addressed. This research is important for three reasons. The Acheulian peoples were among the first to move from Africa to the more temperate regions of the Old World. While many Acheulian sites are known, very few contain in situ material which permit cultural interpretation. From this perspective Cagny-l'Epinette may be an exception which provides information on early human subsistence and social organization. Secondly, the research is important for methodological reasons. When archaeologists excavate surfaces such as this it is extremely difficult to disentangle the \"cultural\" and \"natural\" forces which played a role in their formation. Dr. Dibble's work will help to develop techniques, applicable in a wide range of sites, which may make this possible. Finally, this project includes a number of students and will assist in the training of these young scientists.</td><td> March 1, 1993 </td><td> BCS </td><td> French Lower Paleolithic Excavations</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220829.txt</td><td> 0312000 Population 64 Environmental Biology </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220829</td><td> 1174 POPULATION BIOLOGY</td><td> October 31, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> U of Minnesota-Twin Cities\t 450 University Gateway\t Minneapolis, MN 554151226 612/625-5000</td><td> $111403 (Estimated)</td><td> Mark W.

Two possible, but not mutually exclusive, hypotheses are the focus of the project. These are that the spermatophore provides nutrients to be used by the female in offspring production (paternal investment), or that it delays remating by the female, increasing the time during which the donating male's sperm are used to fertilize eggs (mating effort).

Modern molecular systematic studies of variability have also revealed a previously unsuspected wealth of phenotypic and genotypic diversity in the genus. Comparisons of nuclear-encoded, ribosomal RNA gene sequences revealed distinct groups of Chlamydomonas species that share more recent ancestry with other non-Chlamydomonas species, including groups of colonial Volvocales. Although these new observations conflict with the traditional taxonomy of Chlamydomonas and its allies, based largely on light-microscopy, new evolutionary interpretations of morphological variability suggest that undue influence was accorded primitive features and that ultrastructural and biochemical characters are not in conflict with the new gene data. A broader sampling of Chlamydomonas and allied species will be implemented in a new project designed to expand the molecular and morphological database for these algae and to test evolutionary hypotheses about their origin and diversification. A synthesis of modern genetic and traditional morphological approaches to the study of evolutionary patterns will serve as a key component of a taxonomic reassessment of Chlamydomonas and of other green algae as well.</td><td> April 1, 1993 </td><td> DEB </td><td> Molecular and Organismal Characters in Green Algal Phylogeny</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220844.txt</td><td> 0311000 Polar Programs-Related 42 Geological Sciences </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220844</td><td> 5112 ANTARCTIC GEOLOGY & GEOPHYSICS</td><td> June 30, 1998 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Ohio State Univ Res Fdn\t 1960 Kenny Rd\t Columbus, OH 432101016 614/292-3732</td><td> $55971 (Estimated)</td><td> Scott Borg \t OPP OFFICE OF POLAR PROGRAMS \t O/D OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR </td><td> a9220844</td><td> </td><td> Peter-Noel Webb (Principal Investigator current)</td><td> March 12, 1998 </td><td> This award supports an integrated seismic, sedimentologic, and paleontologic investigation of glacio-marine stratigraphy of the Ross Sea continental shelf.

It is obvious that almost any animal's life history is malleable by environmental effects such as temperature or food level. However, two aspects of that malleability are not well understood. First, there is increasing evidence that the pattern of environmental sensitivity varies among different populations of the same species. Second, it is unclear whether natural selection has molded those different patterns of sensitivity and, if it has, how it has done so. These two basic questions will be addressed by this research. There are several ways in which the lessons from this study may be applied to other problems. First, conservation biology is focusing increasingly on how to restore viable populations of a species to an area from which it has been extirpated. This work will help document how \"interchangeable\" are individuals from different populations of the same species and thereby whether it is ever advisable to draw colonists from a population elsewhere in the species' range. Second, one of the major aspects of life history of this fish is its accrual and use of fat stores.

Genetic dissection and mapping of these genes on chromosomes have always been an important aim of quantitative genetics as it could lead to a better understanding of the structure of polygenic systems and also to identification of major chromosome regions for further genetic study, genetic engineering or selection. To map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) accurately, a complete linkage map is necessary and is now made possible with the rapid advance of recombinant DNA technology. There have been many statistical methods proposed for mapping QTLs, notably the interval mapping method proposed by Lander and Botstein, but none of them has taken a full use of complete linkage map information on mapping QTLs. This project proposes to study an alternative mapping strategy which combines the interval mapping with an interval test. This method will be able to test for a QTL on a marker interval independent of the effects of QTLs at other regions of chromosomes and thus will be asymptotically unbiased.

The bacteria resident in the hindguts of termites can fix atmospheric molecular nitrogen into nitrogen compounds that are incorporated into termite tissues. When termites die or excrete nitrogenous wastes, free-living bacteria metabolize the organic nitrogen into ammonia and nitrates which are then available as nutrients for plants. However, the quantity of nitrogen fixed by termite bacteria is unknown, because many factors influence rates of nitrogen fixation. These factors include temperature and the nitrogen content and acidity of the wood eaten by termites.

Most existing decomposition models predict rates indirectly form measures of regional climate and litter chemical composition. Mechanistic models of litter decay, based on the actual level of microbial activity, are still lacking. This reduces our ability to predict the effects of ecosystem disturbances such as those anticipated form global climate change. We will address this problem by evaluating a decomposition model based directly on microbial production of enzymes involved in litter breakdown. Our model is based o the testable hypothesis that microbial populations grow by optimizing the relative production of extracellular enzymes that obtain essential carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) from their environment. We propose that microbes will change the amount of (C-acquiring enzymes produced depending on the availability of N compounds in the environment. If inorganic N compounds are easily obtained, microbes should allocate more of their resources to producing C-acquiring enzymes. This should result in grater microbial growth and faster decomposition of litter. If inorganic N is in low supply, microbes should produce more organic N- acquiring enzymes and allocate less resources towards acquiring C compounds. This should result in both reduced microbial growth and decomposition rats for litter. To evaluate this model, we will place mesh bags containing three of types of leaf litter on forest soil plots. Some of these plots will receive N fertilizer at two levels of application. Others will not receive N fertilizer. This will provide a range of variation in inorganic N availability over which to test the model. During decomposition, litter samples will be collected and analyzed for microbial biomass and the activities of several enzymes involved obtaining C and N form organic compounds. These enzyme activities will serve as measures of microbial resource allocation to nutrient acquisition. The significance of our model is that it mechanistically links N availability to decomposition rates. If validated, it may facilitate assessments of nutrient limitation in field studies as well as contribute new information for nutrient cycle modeling. Such information should also improve our ability to predict forest ecosystem responses to inputs of atmospheric N pollution at levels now found in forests near agricultural and urban areas.</td><td> March 15, 1993 </td><td> DEB </td><td> Evaluation of a Resource Allocation Model for Regulation of Litter Decomposition</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220906.txt</td><td> 0312000 Population 64 Environmental Biology </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220906</td><td> 1174 POPULATION BIOLOGY</td><td> December 31, 1996 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> U of MD College Park\t 3112 Lee Building\t College Park, MD 207425141 301/405-6269</td><td> $127691 (Estimated)</td><td> Elizabeth Lyons \t DEB DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY \t BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </td><td> a9220906</td><td> 9109,9251,</td><td> Michele R.

The objectives are three-fold. First, to quantify the degree of inbreeding depression in terms of both male and female function in two populations of both the selfing and outcrossing species. The effects of inbreeding on female reproductive function are well documented, but he effects on male function, such as pollen production are largely unknown. Second, the genetic basis of inbreeding depression will be quantified by two greenhouse breeding experiments. Third, among-family level variation in inbreeding depression will be quantified in the outcrossing M. guttatus as a function of the observed floral variation. This two-species comparison will examine the relationship between the mating system and the genetic basis of the observed inbreeding depression, thus providing baseline information on the genetics driving changes in mating systems in natural plant populations.

Examples of such motility include the swimming of sperm in the uterus or of protozoans in ponds, the movement of mucus and inhaled particles in the trachea and bronchi of the lungs, and the intake of food particles by protozoans. Flagella consist of highly ordered arrays of microtubules, termed axonemes, which run the full length of the cilium or flagellum. Other microtubule-associated proteins, notably dynein, are involved in the transduction of biochemical energy (ATP) to mechanical energy (movement). The axonemal beat is the result of certain of the microtubules sliding longitudinally past others, within the membrane-bound constraints of the flagellum, resulting in a bending of the organelle.

Species reproduction over time will be measured as an indicator of species success. %%% Results should demonstrate the degree to which competition occurs, the role of competition in organizing fungal communities, how well species interaction in culture predict species interactions in the field, the relative importance of antibiotic production in fungal species interactions, and the process and pattern of fungal colonization of submerged wood.

Particularly when resources are limiting, it must be important to utilize resources as efficiently as possible. Those organisms that do so will presumably be at a competitive and evolutionary advantage compared to others who may be less efficient. These ideas seem sensible, but have been difficult to test. It is often not possible to classify behavioral activities. For example, an animal may be simultaneously involved in several activities including thermoregulating, guarding territory boundaries, and seeking a mate as well as food. In addition, it has been difficult to identify the appropriate resources to measure. It is also not clear how investing energy in searching for food affects growth rate, and size and age at maturity. Variation in development rates and pathways can have tremendous impact on the evolution of a species, but few studies have addressed the nutritional causes that contribute to this variation. Orb-weaving spiders provide an excellent model system for the study of resource partitioning and the developmental consequences of shifts in partitioning. Spiders synthesize their web from physiologically important compounds such as proteins. The activity of spinning the orb web and the nutritional investment into the orb can serve no other purpose than prey capture, the resources allocated to the orb web are unavailable for growth or reproduction during that foraging bout, and all prey capture occurs on the orb web; thus, the web must be maintained through periods of reduced prey capture. We will examine the nutritional ecology of foraging in the large, widely distributed, orb-weaving spider Nephila clavipes. Our experiments will involve NMR and gas chromatographic analysis of orb chemistry using spiders from 3 separate populations. The biology of this orb-weaving spider will allow us to clearly distinguish foraging from other activities and to track how different types or resources partitioned between foraging and other activities. We will also be able to identify resources that, when limiting, necessitate trade-offs between foraging and other activities. In addition, we can quantify how the investment of resources into foraging affects growth and development under a variety of environmental conditions, and we can distinguish patterns that are due to genetic differences from those due to environmental differences. This study will address the long-held assumptions of most classical foraging models (that shifts in foraging investment reflect shifts in resource partitioning and that increased foraging efficiency increases relative fitness) and it will finally allow quantification of resource partitioning between foraging and growth, permitting investigation of the precise relationships between variation in foraging investment and variation in developmental programs.</td><td> May 1, 1993 </td><td> IBN </td><td> The Nutritional Ecology of the Web of Nephila Clavipes</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220938.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 64 Environmental Biology </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220938</td><td> 1171 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY</td><td> September 30, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> U of Massachusetts Amherst\t 408 Goodell Building\t Amherst, MA 010033285 413/545-0698</td><td> $275000 (Estimated)</td><td> \t DEB DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY \t BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </td><td> a9220938</td><td> 9169,EGCH,</td><td> William E.

Acid deposition effects the composition of the soil solution and the migration of constituents through the soil. Recognizing that the chemistry and mineralogy of soils are transformed by acid deposition, it is postulated that acidification alters physical properties of soils including the behavior of cementing agents perhaps even in well buffered soils The effects of acid deposition on soil morphology and structure will be examined in two kinds of laboratory experiments. Prolonged leaching of different soils in long columns, and leaching of soils contained in shallower pans subjected to different treatments, including wetting and drying. For controlled experiments, two kinds of cement, carbonated and iron-aluminum oxides will be used in mixed natural and artificial soils. In evaluating the importance of selected cementing agents to soil structure, physical properties of the soil including hydraulic conductivity, cohesion and aggregate stability will be examined by comparing acid and control treatments under different buffering conditions. To the extent possible, non-destructive X-ray, gamma ray or CT-scan observations of the internal structure of the soil will be made to relate changes in internal structure to measured physical properties. Because soil relates to soil chemistry and hydrologic processes, understanding the interrelation among them should improve our ability to predict how different environments respond to acid deposition.</td><td> December 1, 1992 </td><td> EAR </td><td> SGER: The Effects of Acid Deposition on Soil Physical Properties</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_20/a9220970.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 13 Physics </td><td> Award</td><td> 9220970</td><td> 1248 PHYSICS-OTHER</td><td> October 31, 1994 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> U of Washington\t 3935 University Way NE\t Seattle, WA 981056613 206/543-4043</td><td> $420032 (Estimated)</td><td> C.

Specific tasks include: (1) Experimental determination of flame stability limits on a flat-flame burner for selected mixtures of silane, ammonia, and acetylene as a function of unburned gas velocity; (2) Thermodynamic determination of expected flame temperatures and product yields as functions of input compositions, pressure, and initial temperature; (3) Determination of the effects of operating conditions on the properties of the powder produced, specifically what operating conditions devermine whether the individual particles are a mixture of the carbide and nitride or whether the nitride and carbide are in separate particles; (4) Determination of the product properties (chemical composition, purity, particle size distribution, morphology); and (5) Interpretation of the results in terms of mechanisms and commercialization potential. High quality ultrafine silicon nitride/silicon carbide powders have a large potential market in the preparation of advanced ceramic materials via sintering or hot pressing.

We will study the relationship between soil temperature and soil nitrate (a common pollutant in the Great Lakes region) and the production and death of fine roots in sugar maple forests in order to better predict what might happen in pollution increases and/or the climate warms. Our study sites are separated by several hundred kilometers from north to south, and there is a built-in temperature gradient that spans the possible range of temperature increases that may occur due to global warming. In addition, we are going to apply large amounts of nitrate to see what effect this particular pollutant has on the roots. Using small cameras first developed for use during arthroscopic surgery, we will observe the birth, growth and death of roots from small observation tubes permanently installed in the soil. Using this approach, we can compare root activity between colder and warmer forests, and between forests subject to high and low inputs of nitrate. We will also measure rates of root respiration. Because metabolic activity in living cells speeds up as temperatures increase, root respiration rates should be higher in warmer soils. This means that the trees growing on warmer soils must expend more energy to maintain enough living roots to take up water and nutrients. we think that nitrate will also increase root respiration rates, because the nitrate must be converted to ammonium (requiring more energy) before plants can use it as a source of nitrogen for growth.

This concept (called the voltinism-suitability hypothesis) integrates abiotic and biotic environmental influences in order to predict host selection in the face of multiple options for plant- feeding insects. Species of Papilio butterflies are a model system to explore ecological processes of predation, parasitism, and competition as factors affecting host choice. This research will assess the relative significance of these selective pressures compared to the seasonal thermal unit restrictions and insect evolutionary history as determinants of specific feeding choice in generalized insects.

Although this statement is obvious, our understanding of how complex environments affect evolutionary processes is still rudimentary. This study will be one of the first to investigate the evolutionary response to environmental changes over time. The experimental organism is a small pond dwelling crustacean, the water flea Daphnia pulex.. The experiment will contrast evolutionary responses to three types of temporal variability: constant, variable and predictable, variable and unpredictable. The benefits of this study are two-fold. First, this study will greatly extend our fundamental understanding of the evolutionary processes. It will be one of the first forays into an area of evolution that has been long recognized as important, but until now has not been studied. The results have the potential for being a significant next step in the merging of the fields of evolutionary biology and developmental biology. Second, the results of this study will be useful in the development of crop strains. A crucial goal in agricultural genetics is the breeding of strains that will do well over a wide range of growing conditions. This goal is especially critical for farmers in underdeveloped or developing nations where control of growing conditions is poor. By understanding the constraints on how organisms can adapt to variable environments, we can better meet this goal.</td><td> March 1, 1993 </td><td> DEB </td><td> Temporal Predictability in Daphnia pulex</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221030.txt</td><td> 0204000 Oceanography 0319000 Climate Related Activities 44 Physical & Chemical Oceanography </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221030</td><td> 1610 PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY</td><td> January 31, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Interagency Agreement </td><td> Natl Oceanic Atmos Admin\t U.S. Department Of Commerce\t Washington, DC 20230 / -</td><td> $160000 (Estimated)</td><td> Eric C.

This research is the first to experimentally test the hypothesis that mammals and insects in the understory of mature tropical forest control tree species diversity. This hypothesis has important ramifications for tropical forest dynamics, diversity, conservation, and management. Recent observations suggest that when forests lose their mammalian herbivores and seed predators they develop low plant species diversity. Forests with intact mammalian fauna have high species diversity. Poaching and over-hunting in many tropical forest reserves are threatening mammalian herbivore populations. If mammalian herbivores are important, than forests that lose their fauna are likely to lose tree species diversity at an accelerated rate. The forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, will be studied in this research. Our findings indicate that gaps do not affect species diversity in these forests; therefore, the abundance of tree species must be determined in the understory where seeds, seedlings, and saplings are exposed to intensive herbivory. We propose to test the hypothesis that herbivory and seed dispersal control the establishment, composition, and diversity of tree species in species-rich tropical forests. %%% For the past ten years, research in tropical forests has focused on the role of gap-phase dynamics as the primary determinant of tree species diversity. Although studies of seed predation are common, this project represents the first attempt to conduct a community-level experimental test of the effects of mammalian and insect herbivores on tropical forest diversity.

The comparative study will consist primarily of greenhouse experiments with field-collected material, supplemented with field work to quantify the habitat differences among the species and their populations. The major experiment will be a growth study of several populations of each species in a multifactorial set of light, moisture, and nutrient treatments, designed to determine whether the four species differ in the range of environments in which they can successfully survive and reproduce. By evaluating the mechanisms of morphological and physiological response to the treatments, I can determine whether differences in environmental tolerance among the species are associated with differences in the amounts or patterns of functionally adaptive phenotypic plasticity. Finally, I will compare the environmental tolerance of populations within species to determine whether the degree of plasticity influences the degree to which conspecific populations in different habitats differentiate genetically. A second, smaller greenhouse experiment will examine in detail the specific aspects of root system plasticity that contribute to species tolerance or intolerance of variation in soil nutrients and moisture.//</td><td> June 1, 1993 </td><td> DEB </td><td> The Relation of Phenotypic Plasticity to Ecological Breadth in Four Annual Polygonum Species</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221038.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 13 Physics </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221038</td><td> 1248 PHYSICS-OTHER</td><td> May 31, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> Texas A&M Research Fdn\t 3578 TAMUS\t College Station, TX 778433578 409/845-8670</td><td> $451594 (Estimated)</td><td> C.

Although much larger than the electron, protium possesses a de Brogile wave length which is similar to the expected dimension of the reaction coordinate in simple H transfer reactions. This property has led to the recognition that the behavior of protium is poised between classical and quantum mechanical behavior. Published studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that quantum effects contribute significantly to several enzyme catalyzed H transfer reactions at room temperature. Ongoing experiments suggest that this phenomenon will be a general one for enzyme catalyzed reactions. A major difficulty in the unambiguous demonstration of tunneling has been the absence of suitable experimental probes. A series of protocols have been developed toward this end: these include the comparative study of H/T and D/T isotope effects and their temperature dependences. Investigations during the next funding period will include the following areas: (1) A number of new enzyme catalyzed H transfer reactions will be examined for tunneling, in order to establish a data base for this phenomenon. In particular, the PI plans to focus on the flavin containing enzymes, monoamine oxidase and glucose oxidase: (2) Studies of the influence on tunneling of specific protein substrate interactions will be pursued through the use of site-specific mutagenesis; and (3) Computational work will be continued, with the goal of reproducing experimental data and providing suitable models for the mechanism of tunneling in enzyme reactions. %%% Although electron tunneling in proteins has been extensively studied, little attention has been paid to nuclear (hydrogen) tunneling.

Recent studies in this laboratory have shown that sugars and acetate specifically and coordinately repress seven maize photosynthetic gene promoters. The repression is effective at physiological concentrations of these metabolites, and overrides regulation by light, cell type, and developmental stage. Metabolic repression of transcription appears to be a major regulatory circuit in maize and is susceptible to biochemical and molecular genetic analyses using protoplast transient expression methods established in this laboratory. The project can be divided into two parts: the first part is to continue the study of transcriptional mechanisms directly involved in glucose- and acetate-mediated photosynthetic gene repression. Using a well characterized maize photosynthetic gene promoter (the cabZm5 promoter) fused to an assayable reporter gene, the investigator will begin to define the cis-acting regulatory DNA elements mediating metabolic repression. The investigator will also characterize the changes in DNA-protein interactions which follow and/or mediate repression. The second part aims to understand how the glucose concentration is sensed and transduced. Various glucose analogues, chemical inhibitors, and maize hexokinase mutants will be used to determine whether glucose phosphorylation or metabolism is required for repression. Because preliminary results suggest cAMP can be a relevant second messenger in the maize system (as in yeast and vertebrates), the effects of agents impacting cAMP or cAMP-dependent protein kinases will be investigated. Finally, to test regulatory concepts generated by work using protoplast transient expression assays, the investigator will begin to create a transgenic maize system and analyze transgenic maize plants. The results from this project will provide much needed insight into metabolite-mediated signal transduction and gene regulation essential to plant growth and development.</td><td> April 15, 1993 </td><td> IBN </td><td> Regulatory Mechanisms of Metabolic Repression in Higher Plants</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221091.txt</td><td> 0201000 Agriculture 64 Environmental Biology </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221091</td><td> 1182 ECOLOGY</td><td> May 31, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> University of Florida\t 219 Grinter Hall\t Gainesville, FL 32611 352/392-1582</td><td> $200000 (Estimated)</td><td> \t DEB DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY \t BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </td><td> a9221091</td><td> </td><td> Lincoln P.

Monarchs larvae feed on milkweed plants and sequester poisonous cardenolides from them. These chemicals protect the butterflies from predation because they are bitter and cause birds to vomit. Monarch butterflies migrate each fall to Mexico, then reinvade eastern North America the following spring. Since cardenolides change during the annual migration cycle, monarchs feeding on different milkweed species lose their deterrent qualities at different rates. Fall migrants feed on a weakly emetic milkweed; subsequent cardenolide loss leads to a partial breakdown of their chemical defense in Mexico, where orioles and grosbeaks eat millions of butterflies each winter. However, monarchs that survive and migrate back to the USA lay their eggs on extremely poisonous southern milkweeds, producing a new generation of apparently toxic butterflies that complete the spring migration northward to Canada. Bioassays using birds and chemical assays of the cardenolides will document the postulated increase in toxicity of the spring generation. The results should provide definitive evidence that the milkweed-based chemical defense of the monarch is a predictably dynamic phenomenon inextricably entwined with its annual migration cycle. %%% Logging of the fir forests in central Mexico is destroying the overwintering habitat of the monarch butterfly. Because of this, the monarch's migration in Eastern North America has been designated an endangered biological phenomenon, a new category of biodiversity conservation. This research program will document the biology of the spring remigration before the predicted collapse of the monarch population over the next 10-15 years.

It has proven extremely difficult, however, to predict the precise environmental circumstances under which high genetic variation is related to superior abilities. This is in part due to a lack of understanding about the interaction between environmental, genetic and physiological effects, and also to a lack of understanding about the specific mechanisms responsible for these relationships. This project will examine the interaction between environmental stress, genetic variation and performance in a model population of earthworms. Earthworms were chosen because of their short life cycles, their availability in the large numbers necessary for this work, and their importance in terrestrial ecosystems. Experiments will involve both short term (one generation) and long term (many generations) of environmental stress. The proposed mechanisms responsible for the phenomena will be investigated using genetic experiments. This will be the most extensive characterization of the relationships between genetic variation and physiological performance in any organism to date.

Recently, there has been an increase in forest regeneration in this region. This study is designed to gather field data from a variety of sites that will be used to parameterize a model of forest development based on actual starting conditions measured in the field. Forest dynamics is a function of seed dispersal, seedling establishment, and differential growth rates of component species. In this study field experiments will be conducted in a range of forest habitats to determine the role of seed dispersal and herbivory in effecting forest regeneration. The results from these experiments will be used to adjust and improve the forest dynamics model called SORTIE. Models such as SORTIE provide baseline data under known conditions against which it will be possible to compare actual patterns of forest regeneration. The mechanisms associated with the model will dramatically increase our ability to predict changes in forest vegetation. The ability to predict changes will have important implications for global climate change and its effects on future biodiversity. %%% Previous approaches to modelling forest dynamics have relied exclusively on average response variables and average environmental conditions. The SORTIE model represents a vast improvement over earlier models because it is truly spatially explicit. Initial conditions will be derived from positions of individual trees and saplings measured in the field. In addition, the actual environmental conditions in different stands will be measured and incorporated into the model. The role of herbivores in forest regeneration is being measured and added to the model.

The vesicles are filled with ambient gas and surrounded by a membrane composed only of protein (no lipids). Gas vesicles come in a variety of shapes but generally contain a cylindrical mid-section with conical ends. Although their exact function is controversial, their buoyancy induces cells to float and thereby increases the availability of light for photosynthesis and oxygen for respiration. Biosynthesis of gas vesicles proceeds bidirectionally starting from the apicies of the cones with incorporation of additional subunits in the central region. The vesicle membrane is impermeable to water and accumulation of gases in the vesicle interior is thought to occur only as a result of passive diffusion of dissolved gases in the medium.

Dr. Seeley will examine three distinct operations in honey bee colonies that require the joint activity of two castes, and will aim to determine for each operation how information flows between the castes so that their rates of activity stay in proper balance. The three operations are nectar acquisition, nest thermoregulation by evaporative cooling, and comb construction. This research addresses a fundamental problem faced by any organization in which there is division of labor, namely the coordination of interdependent labor groups within the organization. This is a severe problem when one group must adjust to unpredictable changes in the activity level of a second group. For example, in the case of the bees, whenever the weather turns hot and the hive begins to overheat, bees working inside the hive spread more water for cooling and bees working outside the hive must accordingly increase their water collection. The solution is the creation of various lines of communication between the groups. These communication links are not well understood for animal societies, even those such as the honey bee society where it has long been known that there is an elaborate division of labor. Hence this research will address an important gap in our understanding of how intricate animal societies work, and it may well provide ideas on how to better coordinate labor in human organizations.</td><td> May 1, 1993 </td><td> IBN </td><td> Social Organization of Foraging by Honey Bees</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221156.txt</td><td> 0106000 Materials Research 15 Metals, Ceramics & Electronic Materials </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221156</td><td> 1715 METALS, CERAMICS, & ELEC MATRS</td><td> January 31, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> MIT\t 77 Massachusetts Avenue\t Cambridge, MA 021394307 617/253-1000</td><td> $239800 (Estimated)</td><td> LaVerne D.

The system will involve a three part heat pipe assembly with sodium as heat transfer fluid.

Given the potential anthropogenic changes in climate, the need for long-term, baseline data on forest community dynamics increases. However, there are few areas with large, intact stands of old-growth forest available for long-term inventory and monitoring. This research will use existing data bases from two old-growth stands in northern Michigan to address hypotheses concerning the long-term stability and dynamics of northern hardwood forests.

Using ectomycorrhizal mat communities as discrete experimental systems, this research will attempt to define the specific role of these ecologically important fungi in the EcM fungus-host tree symbiosis through their capacity to exploit environmentally significant nitrogen and phosphorus resources in decaying soil organic matter. The specific objectives of this research are to: 1) assess the ability of mat-forming EcM fungi to process soil organic matter by changes in substrate nitrogen and phosphorous chemistry and the production of extracellular enzymes, 2) determine how EcM fungi dissociate reactive polyphenol-protein complexes using extracellular enzymes, siderophores or biosurfactants as possible mechanisms, and 3) measure the ectomycorrhizal contribution to soil enzyme activities using polyclonal antibodies raised against enzymes from pure cultures.

She will continue her archaeological and associated documentary studies into change in the district of Jarrestad which is located in the province of Skane, southern Sweden. Throughout the Early and Middle Iron Age (ca. 500 BC - AD 800) Skane was composed of a number of stratified autonomous political systems. During the Late Iron Age or Viking period (AD 800 - 1100) these polities passed not only from prehistory into history, but also from existing as several middle- range societies to unification with an emergent centralized state which was developing in Western Denmark. The goal of this research is to understand how this change took place and what were the processes which underlay it. To achieve this goal MS Thurston will make use of early written documents and will also rely on the excellent archaeological data base available. In addition she wishes to study changes in the size and location of settlements and to determine the extent to which a changed settlement pattern reflects outside imposition by a dominant power. She will use the technique of soil phosphate analysis. Extensive research has shown that prolonged human habitation changes soil characteristics and results in a significant enrichment in phosphorus. Through controlled excavation in known sites - which will allow the construction of precise stratigraphies -, soil sampling and subsequent phosphate analysis, settlement size can be determined. Settlement hierarchies and the pattern of relationships between individual sites can then be established. While archaeological data make it clear that in some regions states emerge through a process of internal development, perhaps more often such complexity develops through a secondary process in which local groups unify in response of changes in neighboring regions. This took place in areas as disparate as lowland Middle America and Northern Europe. However relatively little archaeological attention has been devoted to secondary state formation and MS. Thurston's research will help to remedy this situation. The work is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will, hopefully, shed new light on how social complexity develops and finally it will assist in the training of a promising young scientist.</td><td> January 1, 1993 </td><td> BCS </td><td> Dissertation: Prehistoric Development and Change in Southern Scandinavia</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221228.txt</td><td> 0206000 Telecommunications 31 Computer Science & Engineering </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221228</td><td> 4090 ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH</td><td> February 28, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Amer Library Assoc\t 50 East Huron Street\t Chicago, IL 606112729 312/280-4267</td><td> $57641 (Estimated)</td><td> Mark A.

The objective of this project is to develop methods to automatically represent text-based documents from a large collection in a way which facilitates semantically precise retrieval. A critical problem in representing documents is that words in the documents are not accurate descriptors of document content. This is in part due to the polysemy of natural language: A single concept can be described in many different ways. Most current approaches fail to account for this, as they determine semantic relevance using co-occurrence of words in documents. The approach is to index documents so that they are representationally similar when they are semantically related, not just when they coincidentally share terms. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Neural Network theory are foundations of the work. This approach is demonstrated to be similar to the best current technique for statistical semantic analysis of documents: Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). The work suggests a generalization of LSI, a linear and metric technique, to non-linear and non-metric techniques. This work is expected to provide a well-founded theoretical framework for document indexing based on MDS, to advance the use of neural network techniques in document indexing, and to help in the quantitative evaluation of current document retrieval methods. ***</td><td> August 1, 1993 </td><td> IIS </td><td> Learning Semantic Representations for Information Retrieval</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221277.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 12 Chemistry </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221277</td><td> 1942 UNIMOLECULAR PROCESSES</td><td> March 31, 1996 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> U of Cal Berkeley\t Berkeley, CA 94720 415/642-6000</td><td> $467000 (Estimated)</td><td> Kenneth M.

Experimental data on dynamical processes in these biomolecules will be obtained via the measurements of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate constants; development of appropriate methodologies for measuring heteronuclear relaxation rate constants will be necessary. NMR spectroscopy is a powerful method for obtaining detailed, site- specific information on the structure and dynamics of small- to medium-sized biomolecules in solution. By measuring various NMR relaxation rate constants for specific nuclei in molecule it is possible in principle to characterize the types, amplitudes and rates of various internal motions over a wide range of time scales. The specific aim in the RNA studies is to determine the general characteristics of dynamical processes in RNAs, such as the relative mobilities of bases and sugars in loops and duplex regions, the dynamics of nucleotides in loop regions or bugles compared to nucleotides in duplexes, and the relative mobilities of mismatched basepairs compared to standard Watson-Crick basepairs. The specific aim of the protein research is to study the internal dynamics of several members of a calmodulin superfamily of calcium-binding proteins. %%% The internal mobility and flexibility of biomolecules play key roles in virtually all biological processes; for example, fundamental processes such as enzyme activity, molecular recognition and various molecular transport mechanisms depend heavily on the intramolecular dynamics of participating proteins, nucleic acids and other biomolecules. Thus, to obtain a better understanding of the physical basis for the functional activity of these biomolecules it is extremely important to probe their dynamical properties. To date very few physical studies have been made of the structure and dynamics of RNAs, and thus the proposed NMR experiments should provide invaluable information regarding these molecules which have a central role in so many fundamental, cellular processes. The dynamics studies of the calcium-binding proteins will be very important for understanding their functional activity and for helping to establish the basic principles underlying the inter-relationships of protein structure, function and dynamics. The calcium ion functions as a second messenger in a range of biological processes. In these systems, transient variations in the concentration of calcium ion are translated by regulatory calcium-binding proteins, which undergo conformational changes when they bind calcium ions. The structural aspects of calcium-binding proteins have been under investigation in many laboratories for some time, but only recently has it become feasible to study in detail their internal, dynamical properties.</td><td> January 1, 1993 </td><td> MCB </td><td> Studies of RNA and Protein Dynamics via NMR Relaxation Measurements</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221283.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 13 Physics </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221283</td><td> 1241 ATOMIC & MOLECULAR PHYSICS</td><td> July 31, 1996 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> U of Cal San Diego\t 9500 Gilman Drive, Dept. 0934\t La Jolla, CA 920930934 858/534-0246</td><td> $487072 (Estimated)</td><td> C.

Shock waves shape the mass spectrum of diffuse interstellar clouds, and powerful hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic computer codes will be used to study the interaction of shocks with clouds. Shock waves can produce water masers, which are signposts of massive star formation, and the conditions under which this can occur will be evaluated. Many of the heavy elements of the interstellar medium, which are produced by stars, are locked up in tiny dust grains; the sputtering, vaporization, and shattering of these grains in interstellar shocks will be calculated.</td><td> March 1, 1993 </td><td> AST </td><td> Theoretical Studies in Interstellar Astrophysics</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221293.txt</td><td> 0000912 Computer Science 20 Mathematics </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221293</td><td> 5980 WESTERN EUROPE PROGRAM</td><td> February 29, 1996 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> MIT\t 77 Massachusetts Avenue\t Cambridge, MA 021394307 617/253-1000</td><td> $13250 (Estimated)</td><td> Jeanne E.

This PI has recently succeeded in preparing a class of transition metal phthalocyanine compounds that are stable ferromagnetic materails with high Tc. The basis for this SGER grant is to provide an opportunity to further characterize and tailor magnetic properties such as coercivity, remanence and saturation field by controlling the conditions for synthesis of these materails to achieve, for example optimized particle size and amount of sbsorbed oxygen, and to study the role of catalysts in bringing about phase transformations that yield ferromagnetism at relatively low temperatures where pyrolysis is absent.</td><td> September 1, 1992 </td><td> DMR </td><td> SGER - Novel Ferromagnetic Materials</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221301.txt</td><td> 0104000 Information Systems 99 Other Sciences NEC </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221301</td><td> 6855 INFORMATION & DATA MANAGEMENT</td><td> August 31, 1996 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> U of Texas Austin\t P.O Box 7726\t Austin, TX 787137726 512/471-6424</td><td> $156604 (Estimated)</td><td> \t IIS DIV OF INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS\t CSE DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR</td><td> a9221301</td><td> 9216,HPCC,</td><td> Abraham Silberschatz (Principal Investigator current)</td><td> June 20, 1995 </td><td> 9221301 Silberschatz Transaction Management in a Heterogeneous Database Environment This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. A multidatabase system (MDBS) consists of a number of sites which run distinct commercial database management systems (DBMSs). The goal of an MDBS is to integrate the DBMSs, allowing applications to access data from, without requiring modifications to, the individual DBMSs. The autonomous user organizations in a multidatabase system generally have invested substantial capital in the DBMS and may, rightly, be unwilling to modify or lose control over their DBMSs. Therefore, it is imperative to develop multidatabase transaction processing methods that allow a high degree of local autonomy, but support users' data in a consistent and reliable manner. This research investigates how to manage and guarantee consistency of data residing in heterogeneous DBMSs, while adhering to the autonomy requirements of the participant DBMSs. The MDBS transaction management schemes developed in this research have the following characteristics: (1) adapt to MDBS environments, existing techniques for ensuring database consistency based on preserving transaction atomicity and serializability; (2) utilize alternate correctness criteria that relax the serializability and atomicity requirements. Pilot systems developed for both the serializability and the relaxed serializability models are used to conduct performance evaluation to ascertain that the developed schemes permit a high degree of concurrency. The results of the research will provide the basic transaction management mechanisms necessary for the development of a complete multidatabase management system. ***</td><td> September 1, 1993 </td><td> IIS </td><td> Transaction Management in a Heterogeneous Database Environment</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221304.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 21 Mathematics </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221304</td><td> 1260 INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM</td><td> March 31, 1994 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Amer Statistical Assoc\t 1429 Duke Street\t Alexandria, VA 223143461 703/684-1221</td><td> $20000 (Estimated)</td><td> Jean Thiebaux \t DMS DIVISION OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES \t MPS DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN</td><td> a9221304</td><td> </td><td> Barbara A.

It focuses on three RNAs that span a broad range of sizes and structural motifs: dodecamer with non-canonical UU base pairs, a 30 nucleotide autolytic RNA, and a 160 nucleotide domain of the Tetrahymena intron. These RNAs will be examined with X-ray crystallography and several biochemical methods. Thermal denaturation, kinetic, and chemical protection studies will be used to refine understanding of the crystallographic structure. By integrating structural and biochemical results, Dr. Kundrot expects to obtain a better understanding of these RNA structures and how they function. %%% It has become increasingly apparent in the last decade that RNAs play many roles in a cell that are important in human health and biotechnology. The structures RNAs adopt are of manifest importance because they play central roles in the regulation of gene expression ranging from protein recognition sites to self- splicing active sites. The three-dimensional structure of RNA molecules must be determined if we are to understand how RNA can adopt stable folds and perform functions such as catalysis. Dr. Kundrot proposes to determine the structure of three RNA molecules: a self-cleaving RNA, an RNA with unusual base pairs, and a RNA folding domain that is more than twice as large as the largest RNA structure known today. These structures will provide with new insights into how RNA functions in cells and these insights will help in the development of drugs to improve human health and will open up new areas in biotechnology.</td><td> May 1, 1993 </td><td> MCB </td><td> Structure and Biochemistry of Biologically Important RNAs</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221309.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 31 Computer Science & Engineering </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221309</td><td> 2880 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU</td><td> May 31, 1993 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Rocky Mnt Software Engr\t 1670 Bear Mountain Drive\t Boulder, CO 803036838 303/499-4782</td><td> $6185 (Estimated)</td><td> Bruce H.

All have this in common: they are biological solutions, based on the living organism they wish to control, and to the whole fabric of life to which these organisms belong.

We will identify attributes of the landscape that are favored by a predator on aphids, the ladybird beetles. This knowledge could allow us to naturally reduce the number of insect pests by designing an agricultural landscape that promotes a large population of predators. The first step in this research is to define the link between various crop types and the predatory insect. This is done by determining if there is a match between the abundance of naturally occurring stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in the insect predators and the agricultural crop. A future step will be to link the spatial distribution of the predators with respect to landscape elements. These two steps are a unique approach to studying the behavior of insects because they combine technology from geology and chemistry (analysis of naturally occurring stable isotopes), entomology (insect population dynamics, biological control), and geography (landscape mapping using geographical information systems).</td><td> May 1, 1993 </td><td> DEB </td><td> Biogeochemical and Ecological Analysis of the Population Dynamics of the Spotted Ladybird Beetle Using Geographic Information Systems and Naturally Occurring Isotopes</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221325.txt</td><td> 0311000 Polar Programs-Related 42 Geological Sciences </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221325</td><td> 5116 ANTARCTIC GLACIOLOGY</td><td> December 31, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> University of Maine\t 5717 Corbett Hall\t Orono, ME 044695717 207/581-1476</td><td> $113352 (Estimated)</td><td> Julie Palais \t OPP OFFICE OF POLAR PROGRAMS \t O/D OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR </td><td> a9221325</td><td> </td><td> Michael L.

Histories of individual forest stands, recorded in the sediment, will identify successional communities in the fire-dominated forest ecosystem before hemlock invasion 3000 years ago, making it possible to see whether disturbances made some areas particularly invasible, thus influencing hemlock entry and the locations of hemlock patches that have occupied those sites ever since. By dating hemlock arrival at a series of sites in extreme environments, near bogs or lakes or on coarse soils, we will test the alternative hypothesis that differences in the physical environment were responsible for the locations of hemlock patches. Fine-scale analyses of sediment and time-series analyses of the resulting data will explore changes in successional pathways as the disturbance regime changed from fire to wind 3000 years ago. Modeling will be used to investigate the dynamic changes that have occurred in the positions of boundaries between stands in the forest mosaic. The results will be useful for demonstrating the response of forest communities to climate, including changes in disturbance regimes which may accompany Global Warming.

Despite the tremendous body of research about Native American communities, and about the Lakota of South Dakota in particular, the participation of American Indians as wage laborers in the U.S. economy remains hidden. Similarly, the choices made by Lakota households among options of wage labor, informal economic activities and urban migration to meet their needs have not been explored. The thesis of this project is that incorporation into capitalism is a culturally constituted process, both influenced by and influencing the trajectory of the world economic system. Extensive qualitative interviews will be conducted with Lakota people from the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Indian Reservations. Interview participants will be selected to reflect three communities on each reservation and from four urban areas where Lakota people migrate for wage work. Archival resources and U.S. Census data will be combined with interview information to examine the process of economic incorporation and household decision-making from 1900 to the present.

To preserve their society, they twice enacted new demographic regimes which were accompanied by a change in ethnic group membership. This project hypothesizes that the first regime, developed in the 18th century, was necessitated by the low fertility and high mortality of the frontier situation, and emphasized the acceptance of in- migrants from societies being fragmented and dispersed by the expansion of the colonial frontier, The second regime was enacted in Indian Territory where the possibilities for in-migration were limited, and this regime emphasized the attainment of a fertility level sufficient to balance mortality. These hypotheses will be tested by reference to nineteen censuses and enumerations of the Creeks taken from 1812 to 1910.

These research topics are indispensable to the effort of increasing luminosity at the IUCP Cooler Ring and are also important to modern high brightness storage rings. The proposed research is also important in training the accelerator physics graduate and undergraduate students. The task A studies \"Impedances and Instabilities measurement of the Cooler\". Topics of interest are coherent instabilities and preservation of small emittance beam in high energy (and high brightness) accelerators. Using the measured beam transfer function, the impedance can be deduced. Model simulation and analytic evaluation of the Vlasov equation will be compared with experimental data. These experiments will help to understand better the current limitation of the Cooler Ring. It will also provide information for the design of damper system. Through this series of experiments, we will be able to understand the dynamics of coherent instability and multidimensional Landau damping on the coherent growth. These experiment can also be important to Plasma physics. The task B studies \"Phase and Amplitude Modulations in Parametric Resonances\". The experiment is to measure beam responses to the phase or amplitude modulations in the rf system. These response functions are solutions of parametric resonant equations. These experiments are important to understand the diffusion process in the longitudinal phase space. Using the phase feedback loop, highly damped parametric resonant system can be studied as well. Phenomena such as chaos, strange attractors, and bifurcations can be measured.

First, these cells must separate from the outer layer of the early embryo; secondly, they must obtain specific positions within the embryo. To reach these positions, the cells in many cases must migrate considerable distances. Upon reaching their proper location, they become stationary and form stable contacts with each other. It is of great importance to understand on a molecular level how these cellular processes are controlled. This project will use the embryonic optic lobe as a model system to analyze the molecular basis of morphogenetic movements during neuronal development. Using a variety of markers, the position and movement of these cells can be readily followed throughout normal and mutant development. Experiments will focus on the phenotypic and molecular characterization of a gene called sine oculis (so), which is necessary for the development of the optic lobe. Mutations of so cause failure of optic lobe invagination. Most recent analyses show that so encodes a putative transcription factor, that is a protein that is capable of turning on or off the expression of other genes. It is anticipated that the analysis of so and its function during the development of the optic lobe will answer many important questions.</td><td> April 1, 1993 </td><td> IBN </td><td> Embryonic Development of the Visual System</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221408.txt</td><td> 0308000 Industrial Technology 53 Engineering-Chemical </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221408</td><td> 1401 Kinetics,Catalysis &Molec Proc</td><td> February 28, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Purdue Research Foundation\t West Lafayette, IN 47907 317/494-6200</td><td> $160000 (Estimated)</td><td> \t CTS DIV OF CHEMICAL AND TRANSPORT SYSTEMS \t ENG DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING </td><td> a9221408</td><td> </td><td> Lyle F.

The reaction mixture is an emulsion consisting of sulfuric acid and a liquid hydrocarbon mixture of isobutane, olefins, and alkylate product (a mixture of isoparaffins with 5-12 carbon atoms). Nature and rates of chemical and physical transformations in the emulsion or across the interface are determined. Interfacial area will be measured by a novel method. Kinetic models incorporating interfacial area are developed. Approaches to increasing the interfacial area are examined, including increased agitation, higher acid/hydrocarbon ratios, and the use of surfactants or other additives. Clean fuel considerations are increasing demand for alkylates as fuel enhancers at the same time that environmental protection considerations are forcing a phase-out of the most common catalyst for producing them: hydrogen fluoride. This study is a new look at an earlier generation of catalyst to see if improvements in the process can make it competitive.

The data base for the study was obtained from dedicated cruises of the R/V Polar Duke in 1990 and in 1992. The antarctic deep sea and continental shelf environment is the major repository for silica accumulation in the global ocean, and dominates the global silica budget. The Ross Sea is a particularly anomalous area in which large amounts of biogenic silica are accumulating in modern sediments, while the surface production rates are generally below the global average. Moreover the usual similarity between the oceanic silicon and carbon cycle does not hold around Antarctica, and the two cycles are decoupled in that the rate of particulate carbon deposition in the modern sediment is very low. The analysis phase will concentrate on three sites, identified in the field phase, at which the biogenic silica and organic carbon content differed by two or three orders of magnitude. The objectives of the project are to quantify the variability of silica production and dissolution rates in these sites of silica-rich and silica-poor surface sediments through isotope mass spectrometry of the samples obtained on the 1991-92 cruise, and to produce an integrated surface silica budget that will be combined with vertical flux data and sediment accumulation data to be obtained by the cooperating investigators.</td><td> May 15, 1993 </td><td> OPP </td><td> Cycling of Biogenic Silicia in the Water Column of the Ross Sea</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221426.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 61 Life Science Biological 81 Anthropology </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221426</td><td> 1392 PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY</td><td> January 31, 1994 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> PA St U University Park\t 201 Old Main\t University Park, PA 168021503 814/865-4700</td><td> $2750 (Estimated)</td><td> Jonathan S.

The investigator needs to assess the verbal and written reports as to the subsistence adaptations in these populations and to verify that these three groups will allow the appropriate comparisons.</td><td> August 15, 1992 </td><td> BCS </td><td> Exploratory Biodemographic Research Among Foragers and Cultivators in South India</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221437.txt</td><td> 0206000 Telecommunications 31 Computer Science & Engineering </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221437</td><td> 4091 NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE</td><td> September 30, 1994 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> Medical Col of Wisconsin\t 8701 Watertown Plank Road\t Milwaukee, WI 532263548 414/257-8296</td><td> $49838 (Estimated)</td><td> George O.

Some of these hypotheses are about the logic of contract farming arrangements for firms: they examine the relationships between contracting and labor intensity of the production process, the destination of crops for processing, and former firm experience in sharecropping. Other hypotheses are about the impact of contract farming on the families involved. Structured interviews with a sample of contract farming families and of wage-dependent families will be used to test the hypothesis that contract farming provides higher incomes and more stable incomes; that it decreases the range of income-generating auxiliary activities that family members perform; and that success of contract farming is correlated with greater availability of labor resources.

They look similar to clams, at least externally, but are only distantly related in a genealogical sense. Even though brachiopods are not commonly found along seashores today, except in parts of New Zealand and Australia, they were common and diverse over 250 million years ago in the Paleozoic Era and were important elements of the Paleozoic marine biota. For this reason, paleontologists are interested in learning about aspects of their ecology, morphology, growth and behavior, and their temporal and geographic distribution, in part to understand their decline and near extinction. Dr. Sandra Carlson of the University of California at Davis is studying the spire-bearing articulate brachiopods, those bearing distinctive structures inside their valves that look much like two cone-shaped springs and that are involved in obtaining food and oxygen and in reproductive behaviors. The current classification of these organisms suggests that these structures have evolved only once, but preliminary work by Dr. Carlson indicates that is not likely the case. If spire- bearing brachiopods have evolved several times, then placing them together in a single taxonomic group confuses their evolutionary history and constrains work on ecological factors responsible for spire evolution. Study of other morphological features of the fossil and extant organisms will help improve the classification and phylogeny of brachiopods, and help in understanding their geological rise and fall in the Paleozoic.</td><td> March 15, 1993 </td><td> DEB </td><td> Phylogenetic Relationships Among Spire-bearing Articulate Brachiopods</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221460.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 50 Engineering </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221460</td><td> 1340 ENGINEERING EDUCATION</td><td> October 31, 2002 (Estimated)</td><td> Cooperative Agreement </td><td> Texas Engineering Exp Sta\t 332 Wisenbaker Engr.

Wheat rusts are probably the best known because of their serious effects on crop yields. Although host plant specificity is a hallmark of the rusts, little is known about the evolutionary patterns of host tracking and host shifting. This lack of understanding is caused by our rudimentary knowledge of the evolutionary relationships, or phylogeny, of the rusts, both among the rust species and genera and with related basidiomycetes. Dr. Thomas Bruns of the University of California- Berkeley will use molecular genomic techniques to investigate evolutionary relationships at several taxonomic levels among the rust fungi. At the broadest level, DNA nucleotide sequences of the ribosomal genes will be analyzed and mutational differences will be compared among the major groups of rusts and their putative fungal relatives. At lower taxonomic levels, evolutionary relationships among species of two genera, Cronartium and Melampsora, that are important pathogens on pine trees will be investigated by DNA sequencing methods. Patterns of relationship among the rust fungi will be compared with patterns of relationship among pine species to detect lineages where hostplant shifts have occurred. Results from this work should provide a better understanding of host tracking and host shifting in obligate plant pathogens, and will also develop the database and methodology needed to facilitate rapid identification of species within the two selected genera.</td><td> March 1, 1993 </td><td> DEB </td><td> Molecular Systematics of the Non-pedicellate Rust Fungi</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221480.txt</td><td> 0306000 Energy Research & Resources 12 Chemistry </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221480</td><td> 1942 UNIMOLECULAR PROCESSES</td><td> June 30, 1998 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> Purdue Research Foundation\t West Lafayette, IN 47907 317/494-6200</td><td> $718500 (Estimated)</td><td> Kenneth M.

The purposes of the meeting are to familiarize these participating representatives of the pan- European and American research communities with each other's work, and to promote collaboration among them in future research. The subject of this workshop has significant implications for manufacturing systems. Rapid development of technology requires increased precision and robustness in mathematical modelling of the relevant phenomena. This requires going beyond the methods of Classical Control Theory and advancing the frontiers of Analytic and Qualitative Nonlinear Dynamics in Control. Effective design and control of modern dynamical systems, such as robotic manipulators, demand models that recognize their full non linearity and allow for the influence of bounded uncertainty. A formalism developed by the Russian Liapunov offers just that. There is a very strong Eastern European network of researchers building on his work. They had very little contact with the West until very recently, so this meeting will accelerate the diffusion of their valuable research in Western Europe and the U.S. ***</td><td> July 1, 1993 </td><td> INT </td><td> U.S.-European Regional Workshop on Dynamics and Control of Nonlinear Uncertain Systems; Vienna, Austria; July, 1993</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221504.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 64 Environmental Biology </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221504</td><td> 1171 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY</td><td> April 30, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> Cornell University State\t Office of Sponsored Programs\t Ithaca, NY 148532801 607/255-5014</td><td> $230000 (Estimated)</td><td> James E.

This project focuses on the evolutionary history of a diverse group of mammals, the ground squirrels (genus Spermophilus, 42 species) and the prairie dogs (genus Cynomys, 4 species). Because they are active in the daytime, tend to live in groups , and are of considerable economic importance, these animals have been the subject of numerous behavioral and life-history studies and have been central to the development of kinship theory and optimal foraging theory for mammals. To place this knowledge in phylogenetic perspective, the investigators will collaborate with Mexican and Russian colleagues in collecting materials of all known species, for molecular analyses of DNA. A phylogeny or genealogical tree will be constructed based upon mutational differences among the species. %%% A phylogeny of this group of mammals will serve as a framework for testing theories about the origin and maintenance of sociality in mammals and of other behavioral and life-history traits. It will also facilitate measurement of genetic variation within particular lineages. A phylogenetic framework will make possible an evaluation of historical (heritable) factors and current ecological adaptations in molding behavior, life history, and social organization in mammals.</td><td> May 1, 1993 </td><td> DEB </td><td> Molecular Phylogeny of the Spermophilina (Sciuridae: Rodentia)</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221517.txt</td><td> 0304000 Disaster & Natural Hazard 0304010 Earthquake 54 Engineering-Civil </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221517</td><td> 1497 ARCHITECTURE & MECHAN SYSTEMS</td><td> December 31, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> U of Washington\t 3935 University Way NE\t Seattle, WA 981056613 206/543-4043</td><td> $155423 (Estimated)</td><td> Shih-Chi Liu \t CMS DIV OF CIVIL AND MECHANICAL SYSTEMS \t ENG DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING </td><td> a9221517</td><td> </td><td> Sunirmal Banerjee (Principal Investigator current) Charles W.

This strengthening, however, can transfer more loads to the foundation. This research will examine the seismic vulnerability of such structure-foundation systems. The study will review the major methods of strengthening and rehabilitating buildings for seismic loading. The demands of these rehabilitation methods on the foundation will be evaluated and typical deficiencies of commonly used foundation systems will be ascertained. A range of foundation rehabilitation schemes including: a) use of additional piles, b) provision of an additional footing around the perimeter of the building, c) reinforcement of existing footings and pile caps with additional concrete and steel, and d) improvement of structure-foundation connections will be considered. The improved connections may include mechanisms for safely transmitting short duration overloads to the soil or may allow temporary separation of parts of the structure from the foundation to prevent damage to critical elements. The study will involve analyses of a variety of structures and broad categories of foundation systems and soils. Several earthquake induced acceleration records will be used as base excitations for analysis and evaluation. The analytical studies will be correlated with past performance of buildings and foundations during earthquakes. The emphasis will be on developing guidelines and recommendations for selecting the foundation rehabilitation techniques for buildings of intermediate height (approximately 4 to 20 stories).

The central and eastern regions of the United States have a large inventory of such buildings. Progressive collapse can result from punching failure at connections. The main objective of the project is to develop minimum-retrofit strategies to limit the global response and ensure structural integrity during moderate ground motion. To accomplish this, a suitable analysis tool for predicting the response of non- ductile flat-slab buildings under earthquake loading will be developed first. A recently developed three-parameter hysteretic model will be incorporated into an existingnonlinear dynamic analysis program to analyze and compare various retrofit strategies. Experiments aiming at testing retrofit schemes at the connection level for protection against progressive collapse and controlled redistribution of loads will also be carried out. In particular, the concept of using infill walls to improve the lateral load resistance will be studied in some detail. With both experimental and analytical studies, this project is expected to provide an integrated retrofit strategy optimized for a balance between protection at the connection level and a controlled global response.

Such a technique overcomes a lot of problems associated with traditional bracing schemes and holds much promise for broad applications in seismic rehabilitation. One major obstacle in the development of seismic rehabilitation techniques is the lack of a consensus analytical procedure for evaluating the seismic resistance of URM building structures. Currently a unified methodology using the so-called \"Strut-Analogy\" method development will be used as a tool for the analytical modeling for the URM buildings.

The Coalition is comprised of Focus:HOPE and six universities; Detroit-Mercy, Central State, Lawrence Technological, Lehigh, Michigan and Wayne State. The Coalition will design, deliver, test and evaluate, adopt, and disseminate new resources and methodologies usable in both industry and university settings. In consultation with Coalition industry partners, essential course elements in manufacturing engineering and technology will be identified and modularized for presentation through a variety of innovative instructional processes. Optimal use of electronic media and mentors will support an instructional sequence that is inquiry-driven and customized to the current manufacturing functions and experience of the engineer or technologist candidate. To foster global technological access, two foreign languages will be required. Coalition university partners will each develop modules for a knowledge area (course) in which that institution has outstanding expertise. Upon satisfactory completion of all modules associated with a knowledge area, the university responsible for that content will award appropriate credit. Partner institutions will mutually recognize all such course credits earned, consistent with procedures for course credit transfer. Depending on the degree pathway chosen by each candidate, the appropriate accredited institution will confer an associate, bachelor or master level degree. Focus:HOPE's Center for Advanced Technologies (CAT) in Detroit will be the primary development platform for a six-year curricul um integrating hands-on manufacturing skill mastery and interdisciplinary engineering knowledge within an applications context, i.e., the actual production of industry contracts requiring expert use of advanced technologies at competitive levels of quality, cost, and efficiency. Other key features include futuristic 220,000 SF CAT facility, it leading-edge manufacturing equipment and information systems, and its target enrollment of young black adults.

D'Agostino (Co-Principal Investigator current)</td><td> February 26, 1993 </td><td> ABSTRACT Research suggests that repeated, unreinforced exposure to a stimulus (e.g.,image, object, person) results in increased liking for that stimulus. This phenomenon has been termed the \"mere exposure effect\". Recent experiments in the PI's laboratory indicate that awareness of stimulus content inhibits the mere exposure effect, so that subliminal stimuli produce significantly stronger mere exposure effects than do stimuli that are clearly recognized. No extant model of the exposure effect can accommodate this pattern of results. Thus these experiments are designed to test a new theoretical model of the mere exposure effect. This model contends that exposure effects result from \"perceptual fluency\" (i.e., an increase in the ease with which a stimulus is perceived and processed) that is induced by repeated stimulus exposures. When stimulus exposures are subliminal, subjects attribute perceptual fluency effects to properties of the merely-exposed stimulus based on cues provided by the experimenter. In contrast, when clearly- recognized stimuli are used, subjects can attribute fluency effects to the stimulus familiarization procedure, diminishing liking ratings of the merely- exposed stimuli. Five sets of experiments will test the attributional model. The first experiment compares the magnitude of the mere exposure effect for attended vs unattended stimuli, replicating and extending previous work in this area. In the second set of experiments, the PIs examine directly the processes that underly perceptual fluency effects for merely-exposed stimuli. The third set of experiments is designed to assess the relationship between stimulus awareness and perceptual fluency effects in the mere exposure paradigm. In the fourth set of experiments, the PI's examine various experimental manipulations that affect the attribution of liking to previous stimulus exposures in mere exposure effect studies. In the fifth set of experiments, other theoretical issues related to the attributional model will be investigated. The results of these experiments will have important applications in several areas.

The work seeks to develop and understand analysis on Lie groups and Riemannian manifolds through the study of differential operators, singular integrals and variational problems intrinsic to the manifold. Principal directions are (1) the role of renormalization arguments in controlling the behavior of oscillatory phenomena and (2) geometric analysis of higher-order multilinear differential operators with tensor structure. Central to this research is the interplay between geometric structure of manifolds and harmonic analysis of the operators using conformal invariance and geometric symmetrization. Sharp constants for variational problems provide a rich source of geometric and probabilistic information. Insight into the mathematical framework is gained from exact model calculations in conformal string theory and statistical mechanics using the conformal symmetry of critical phenomena. Computation analysis, especially computation and computer graphics, is used to provide intuition and strategy for problems where the geometric structure is too complex for elementary analysis.</td><td> February 15, 1993 </td><td> DMS </td><td> Mathematical Sciences: Geometric Inequalities in Fourier Analysis</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221554.txt</td><td> 0201000 Agriculture 81 Anthropology </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221554</td><td> 1391 ARCHAEOLOGY</td><td> June 30, 1995 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> U of Massachusetts Boston\t 100 Morrissey Boulevard\t Boston, MA 02125 617/287-5370</td><td> $11600 (Estimated)</td><td> John E.

Although indirect dates are available (based on charcoal and other organic materials associated with beans) very few direct determinations have been made and these vary significantly from the ages suggested by the indirect dates. The result is that very little is known about the timing and places of origin on this major New World domesticate. In conjunction with other chemical analyses, this project will permit archaeologists and biologists to understand the process of the domestication and spread of this food crop. The genus Paseolus includes five species of beans which were domesticated and widely used in the pre-Columbian New World. Together with corn and squash they formed the basis for much of the prehistoric diet over North, Middle and South America and were crucial for survival because they contain essential amino acids which are otherwise lacking. Given the presence of wild progenitors it is clear that domestication did take place in the New World but beyond that archaeological understanding is limited. The problem is of interest not only to biologists but also to archaeologists who wish to understand how complex chiefdoms developed. Until recently it was believed that the subsistence base necessary to support such a form of organization required a major domesticate. However recent work has suggested that such social complexity predates the domestication of corn and possibly beans as well. It seems likely that less well known and less productive crops played an important role. Dr. Kaplan's research will help to answer this question. This research is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to both biologists and anthropologists. It will also shed light on the origins of plant domestication and the development of complex societies.</td><td> January 1, 1993 </td><td> BCS </td><td> Accelerator Mass Spectrometer Dating of Prehistoric Domestication from the Americas</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221562.txt</td><td> 0206000 Telecommunications 31 Computer Science & Engineering </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221562</td><td> 4091 NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE</td><td> June 30, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> UT, Memphis, HSC\t 800 Madison Avenue\t Memphis, TN 381033400 901/528-5000</td><td> $318304 (Estimated)</td><td> David A.

The antarctic deep sea and continental shelf environment is the major repository for silica accumulation in the global ocean, and dominates the global silica budget. The Ross Sea is a particularly anomalous area in which large amounts of biogenic silica are accumulating in modern sediments, while the surface production rates are generally below the global average. Moreover the usual similarity between the oceanic silicon and carbon cycle does not appear to hold around Antarctica, and the two cycles are decoupled in that the rate of particulate carbon deposition in the modern sediment is very low. The overall project is an integrated study of the production, vertical transport, dissolution, and deposition processes, using moored instrumentation and direct observations in a series of transects in the Ross Sea by R/V POLAR DUKE, carried out between 1989 and 1991. The vertical flux and dissolution rates were measured by deploying time-series sediment traps at two depths on each of three moorings for a period of fourteen months. In conjunction with transmissometers and current meter arrays, these moorings will allow the measurement and characterization of both vertical and horizontal fluxes of particulate matter during a complete annual cycle of production and sedimentation. The objectives of this renewal are to recover one sediment trap that was redeployed for an additional two years, to complete the analysis of all water column and sediment trap samples that are currently in hand, and to produce a synthesis of all project data sets in cooperation with the other investigators cooperating in this project.</td><td> July 1, 1993 </td><td> OPP </td><td> Biogeochemistry of Carbon and Silicon on the Antarctic Shelf: Particle Flux and Taxonomic Studies</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221580.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 12 Chemistry </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221580</td><td> 1956 STATISTICAL AND SIMULATIONS</td><td> February 28, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Continuing grant </td><td> U of Cal Santa Cruz\t 1156 High Street\t Santa Cruz, CA 950641077 408/429-0111</td><td> $247000 (Estimated)</td><td> Richard L.

Additionally, it is important to understand the dynamics of mixtures of rodlike and random coil polymers, as these mixtures are the precursors to composite materials in which rodlike polymers reinforce a conventional random coil matrix. Optical studies of the diffusion of helical polypeptides have already revealed much about concentrated, isotropic solutions. These studies will be extended to mixtures with random coils and also to liquid crystalline solutions. A special class of polypeptide, the poly(alkylglutamate)s, will facilitate these studies.

Using chemical and electrochemical techniques, a number of structures suitable for the study of superconducting proximity effect are fabricated. One major goal of this work is to study electron transfer phenomena which occur at or near superconductor/molecular phase interfaces. Measurements are conducted above and below the superconducting transition temperature to search for superconducting quantum electron transfer phenomena. Cuprate superconductors are used for the majority of the studies because measurements below transition temperature can be completed readily. The second goal of this research is to fabricate proximity devices based on high temperature superconductor thin films coated with molecular conductors. The modulation of the superconducting transition temperature of the underling cuprate material then is examined. Also, the influence of polymer layer on the transition temperature of the superconductor film is explored. In recent studies, we have demonstrated the first molecular switch for controlling superconductivity. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to develop new types of organic conductor/ superconductor circuits, devices and sensors. Through the study of a variety of molecular conductor/high temperature superconductor structures, information will be acquired that may help to elucidate the nature of superconductivity in the ceramic superconductors and shed light on the conduction mechanism in the polymers. The use of conductive polymers also should provide alternative strategies for making electrical contacts to high-temperature superconductors.

The solution of the differential equations for contaminant transport in heterogeneous aquifers is made difficult by the many varied boundaries and interfaces encountered under natural conditions. Executing numerical solutions methods on a fine time-space grid slows the computations to an extent that can make the method prohibitive. The use of semi-analytical methods offers an alternative to arrive at stable solutions that may result in more accurate forecasting models and a better understanding of contaminant migration in aquifers.

Two types of materials, quasicrystalline alloys and ferrofluids, will be described by models which capture the most relevant energetic and geometrical constraints, while remaining simple enough to perform accurate, analytic calculations of statistical properties. Quasicrystals, a common but complex structure type in intermetallic alloys, appear to be intermediate between conventional crystals and metallic glass. Employing geometrical tiling models as a shorthand description of real atomic positions, the phase diagram and phase transitions among equilibrium structures will be investigated as functions of interactions, composition and temperature. Ferrofluids are colloidal suspensions of microscopic permanent magnets. In addition to technological applications, these materials are of intrinsic scientific interest because they provide an approximate realization of a dipolar hard sphere fluid. This work will establish the nature of phases between the dilute isotropic gas and the close-packed magnetically ordered solid. %%% Theoretical research will be conducted on the basic properties of two partially ordered complex materials. Quasicrystals, which were discovered over a decade ago in certain intermetallic alloys, remain a mystery as to the mechanisms which produce this unusual structure.

The PI's derived a model of consumption by herbivores that incorporates variation in spatial arrangements of plants, and velocities and food processing abilities of animals. The model generated the following hypotheses: 1) Increasing patchiness in plant communities causes encounter rate with resources to decline as foraging time increases. 2) The decline in encounter rate is opposed by increasing resource apparency and size. 3) Spatial pattern fails to influence intake rate when resource encounter rate exceeds an animals food processing rate. 4) At a given scale, the influence of spatial pattern on intake rate will be greatest for animals of intermediate body sizes. To test these hypotheses, the PI's will manipulate spatial patterns of resources, resource apparency, and resource size available to herbivores in laboratory and field experiments. Results from these experiments will provide an assessment of the model's ability to predict intake rate of consumers in comparisons with predictions from more traditional predictive theory. %%% The PI's have developed one of the first models that relates resource patchiness, resource abundance, foraging movements of herbivores, and body size to resource acquisition by herbivores. The model has generated a series of testable hypotheses, some of which are unique and counter-intuitive. Tests of these hypotheses will provide an important contribution toward a much needed general theory of herbivore foraging. Results from this research have important implications for landscape scale management of grazing systems, and for a general understanding of foraging behavior in light of the habitat fragmentation currently occurring in many natural systems.</td><td> April 15, 1993 </td><td> DEB </td><td> Collaborative Research: Linking Environmental Heterogeneityto Foraging Behavior: Plant Community Geometry and Herbivore Functional Response</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221611.txt</td><td> 0206000 Telecommunications 55 Engineering-Electrical </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221611</td><td> 1517 ELECT, PHOTONICS, & DEVICE TEC</td><td> July 31, 1993 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> SRI International\t 333 Ravenswood Avenue\t Menlo Park, CA 940253493 650/859-3571</td><td> $10000 (Estimated)</td><td> Lawrence S.

Consequently, global climate warming may have manifold biological repercussions. However, the effects of climate warming might be ameliorated if evolution can quickly alter the thermal sensitivity of fast-breeding organisms such as insects. This project will use two different approaches to study experimentally how fruit flies respond evolutionary to simulated climate change in the laboratory. The first approach uses an efficient new technique that enables us to breed flies that are very resistant to periodic exposure to heat or cold or both. This approach involves monitoring physiological divergence in stocks of flies that have already been evolving at different temperatures for several years. This study will monitor how quickly physiology responds evolutionarily to a sustained shift in (non-extreme) temperatures. Using both sets of flies, we will determine how quickly the sensitivity of physiology to temperature can evolve as well as any important side effects (life history, resistance to other studies will have direct implications for projection models of how insect populations will respond to global climate warming.</td><td> March 1, 1993 </td><td> IBN </td><td> Experimental Evolution of Ecotherm Thermal Sensitivity</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_21/a9221622.txt</td><td> 0000099 Other Applications NEC 61 Life Science Biological </td><td> Award</td><td> 9221622</td><td> 1119 ANIMAL DEVELOPMENTAL MECHANSMS</td><td> June 30, 1997 (Estimated)</td><td> Standard Grant </td><td> U of Cal San Diego\t 9500 Gilman Drive, Dept. 0934\t La Jolla, CA 920930934 858/534-0246</td><td> $241000 (Estimated)</td><td> Judith Plesset \t IBN DIV OF INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY AND NEUROSCIE\t BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES </td><td> a9221622</td><td> 9178,9251,</td><td> Nicholas D.

These genes will be isolated and sequenced and will be used to prepare riboprobes and antibodies for detection of the gene products within the context of the embryonic and larval tissues. By comparing the protochordate expression domains to those already known for developing vertebrates, Dr. Holland the can generate unprecedented new homologies and use them to evaluate existing theories of vertebrate origins and possibly as a basis for new hypotheses.

This unusual behavior has been confirmed recently by several different spectroscopies including experimental band structure mapping, resonant photoemission, core level spectroscopy and electron energy loss. Nonmetallic overlayers undergo a nonmetal to metal transition with increasing coverage and the nonmetal to metal transition is typically accompanied by a structural transition indicative of a first order transition. University-industry collaborations will assist in characterizing nonmetallic overlayers which exhibit an excitonic insulating behavior. Microscopic probes of structure will be correlated with the more conventional photoemission and resonant photoemission techniques for studying electronic transitions. The similarities between the nonmetal to metal transition in free clusters and at metal surfaces are remarkable, particularly for the metal mercury. The fundamental reasons for the similar variations in metallicity with coordination number, and cluster size (film coverage or thickness) can only be established with further electronic and structural studies. Divalent metal overlayers such as Mg, Ba, and Hg will be investigated and compared with other overlayers exhibiting no nonmetal to metal transition. %%% This research program addresses a very basic and fundamental question: are the surfaces of metals metallic? Conventional measurements to determine metallic character, such as conductivity measurements for example, are difficult to apply to a thin film of material one or two atoms thick deposited on a metal substrate. New approaches to establishing what it means for a metal to be a metal have been developed and can now be applied to materials normally considered metals. There is a need to explore why the sufaces of some material have such fundamentally different properties form those normally associated with that material.

Dr. Lomax has used a simple but powerful approach to isolate the IAA uptake symport by photoaffinity labelling of the protein in purified plant plasma membranes with a tritiated azido-IAA analogue. She has found that the azido-IAA specifically labels two polypeptides of 40 and 42kD in plasma membranes isolated from Cucurbita pepo hypcotyls. Both polypeptides are labeled by azido-IAA with high specific activity, behave as intrinsic membrane proteins, and exhibit a competition specificity for various auxin analogs very similar to that for in vitro and in vivo auxin transport. These data suggest that the protein doublet may be an auxin transport carrier(s). The overall goals of this project are the establishment of function for these specific plasma membrane auxin-binding polypeptides and the investigation of their role in regulating plant development. Dr. Lomax has completed the purification of these very low abundance polypeptides. From the purified protein, she has obtained protein microsequence which has allowed her to design specific oligonucleotide probes. These probes will be used to select the corresponding cDNA clones encoding the 40 and 42kD auxin-binding polypeptides. The specific cDNA clones will be used 1) to determine the nucleic acid and amino acid sequence, 2) for functional expression studies, and 3) as probes for the study of transcriptional control and pattern of expression of the corresponding genes during development. The results of these studies should provide significant insight into both the structure and function of the putative symport protein and the role of IAA uptake in the regulation of growth and development in plants.

It is planned to operate SPASE in conjunction with the new detectors which are being installed as part of the AMANDA (Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array). These new detectors will provide additional information on the muon content of the air showers and therefore reduce the charged cosmic ray background and increase the likelihood of detection of gamma rays.</td><td> March 1, 1993 </td><td> OPP </td><td> South Pole Air Shower Experiment for Gamma Ray Astronomy at Ultra-High Energy</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"
