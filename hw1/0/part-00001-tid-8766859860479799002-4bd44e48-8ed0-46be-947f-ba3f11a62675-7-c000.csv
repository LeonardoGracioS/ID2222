Related problems about  automata, varieties and pseudo-varieties will also be considered.  Algorithmic problems to be considered include the word problem  for non-periodic semigroup varieties, for finitely based  varieties of associative algebras, for presentations and  varieties of inverse semigroups. Other problems to be considered  include the algorithmic classification of finitely generated  subgroups of free groups via finite inverse monoids, the Rhodes  problem for the class of finite groups and the extension problem  for finite inverse automata to various pseudo-varieties of  groups.  This research is in the area of semigroups. A semigroup is  one of the simplest of the abstract mathematical structures,  consisting of a set with one associative operation on it.

The overall objective is to relate changes  in POM composition to water column-based biogeochemical processes  and to assess the importance of these processes in determining the  chemical characteristics of sedimentary organic matter. Observed  variations in POM composition will be interpreted in the context of  current concepts for organic matter preservation. This objective  will be pursued by investigating the composition of organic matter  in samples of phytoplankton populations, particulate matter and  surface sediments from high productivity (Peru Upwelling region)  and oligotrophic (Sargasso Sea) Oceanic environments.   The analytical approach adopted seeks to overcome several  limitations which currently prevent the application of molecular  markers as routine tools in marine geochemistry. Specifically, in-  source MS offers advantages as a rapid, high sensitivity method  which can be used to study compositional features of complex  mixtures over a wide range of molecular sizes and polarities. The  major focus is placed upon structural aspects of macromolecular  constituents of POM, however, an assessment of lipid composition  will also be made in an attempt to provide a more holistic  perspective of POM transformation. The inherent sensitivity of in-  source MS will be exploited by studying compositional variations in  sub-factions of POM separated by flow cytometry. In this way,  chemical variations can be related to well-defined particle  characteristics (size, shape, chlorophyll content), enabling  systematic relationships to be established between the composition  of phytoplankton and POM.",a9201189,Direct Mass Spectrometric Profiling of Water Column Particulate Organic Matter Composition,"May 1, 1992",$247075 (Estimated),Neil R.

Fluxes of  nutrients and trace metals are being determined by using the USC  free vehicle bottom lander and by calculation of gradients in pore  waters of sediments on a millimeter scale. A surprising result of  the initial work is that the highest rate of remineralization of  metals from the sediment appears to be from well oxygenated waters,  not from sediments in the depth range of the oxygen minimum zone.  Moreover the high fluxes are linked with high rates of oxygen  consumption, carbon oxidation, and calcium carbonate dissolution.  Consequently, new work is addressing the association between metal  and carbon cycling. Measurements of fluxes out of the sediments in  Monterey Bay are being compared to ongoing measurements of sediment  trap carbon fluxes (by Chavez) to determine whether seasonality in  the carbon signal is reflected by remineralization rates of metals.  A detailed study is also being made of fluxes derived from  modelling pore water profiles, compared to those from the benthic  chambers, which tend to give higher flux values.

Very often within a single  neuron, neuropeptides are released along with specific  neurotransmitters and modulate their subsequent action. Indeed,  the nervous system is designed to received and transmit information  and neuropeptides are central to those basic processes. While it  is estimated that 100's of neuropeptides are made by nerve cells,  only 1% of all nerve cells express a given neuropeptide gene. Dr.  Taghert will use an innovative molecular genetic approach to  examine the fundamental mechanisms underlying the expression and  release of neuropeptides. He will create and recover  loss-of-function mutations in a specific gene for a precursor  protein that encodes 13 related neuropeptides. By studying  individuals that are chronically deficient in the production of  these molecules, Dr. Taghert will determine function and whether  other neuropeptides share overlapping roles. In addition, he has  developed methodology to put genes back and thus, will assess the  specific capacity of subsets of encoded neuropeptides to restore  lost functions. These experiments will lead to a better  understanding of the roles played by the neuropeptide gene in  individual neurons.

One is to develop a theoretical  understanding of a generic environmental problem of which global  warming and acid deposition are two examples. That problem is  the optimal tradeoff between acting to control environmental  externalities versus delaying control when faced with uncertainty  coupled with learning. The second objective is to apply one or  more of these theoretical models to the global warming problem,  addressing the policy question of the extent to which the U.S.  and other countries should control greenhouse gas emissions now  versus waiting until more is known about the problem before  controlling. This is one of the key issues in the public policy  debate on global warming and, thus, results of this project may  be very significant. The two driving features of the models  developed will be learning that occurs over time reducing  uncertainty and the stock feature of externalities such as global  warming, whereby the stock causes damage but only the flow can be  controlled. The approach of the theoretical part of the project  is to develop a stochastic optimal control problem and to  investigate the comparative static properties of the resulting  model.

One of these gabbros, the Kap Edvard Holm  Complex, exhibits an unusual combination of features related to  stratiform precious metal mineralization. An understanding of  these processes requires detailed field, petrologic, isotopic, and  chemical analyses, combined with theoretical analysis of the  thermodynamic and transport characteristics of magma-hydrothermal  systems.

For  interpreting the finescale X record in terms of quantitative  paleoclimatic parameters two models have been proposed in which the  magnetic source is either eolian and of constant grainsize, or  pedogenic and thus finer-grained in the paleosol. We have compared  the room temperature rock magnetic properties of a sequence of four  identical paleosol and loess horizons (that last 150ka) from one  arid climate and one humid climate site, equidistant from the  source of loess. First, we confirm that recent observations by  others are correct: that the magnetic grainsize is finer in the  paleosol layers than in the loess, suggesting a partly pedogenic  origin. Next, we have extended the magnetic measurements to low  temperatures (to 15K) to obtain semi-quantitative estimates of the  ultrafine fraction and confirmed them by bulk grainsize  distribution measurements. Thirdly, using additional data  (Mossbauer absorption spectra), we have shown that the magnetic  mineral is not the same: there is more eolian magnetic (> l um)  and less pedogenic maghemite (~10 nm) in the loess horizons.  Overall, the humid site does show a higher pedogenic fraction and  a comparison of such paired magnetic depth profiles can separate  the eolian input from the pedogenic production.  This is an extended supply in which the average magnetic  record from two nearby arid climate sites will be compared with the  average of two humid climate sites, to separate the common eolian  record from the regional pedogenic one. Quantitative estimates of  magnetic mineral composition and grainsize will be obtained from  combined low temperature magnetic and Mossbauer data, and then the  inferred variations in pedogenesis (interpreted as regional  paleomonsoon strength variations) will be checked for selected  samples using independent measures of pedogenic alterations. bulk  grainsize distribution, chemical indices such as (A1 2O3 + Fe2O3)  (Na2O +K22O), FeO/FeO3, CaCo3 content etc., authigenic clay  mineralogy and SEM textural evidence of pedogenic maturation and  CBD- extracted soluble finegrained iron oxide content.

As a result, proteins, platelets and cells  will deposit upon its surface. By modifying the surface  properties of the polymers, one can reduce the interfacial  free between them and water, and thus reduce the thermodynamic  driving force for deposition. The following surface  modification technique, which employs two immiscible liquids  in contact, will be investigated. One of the liquids is water  and contains a water soluble surfactant, while the other  liquid is an organic compound which is selected so as to be a  solvent for the polymer substrate. It is convenient for the  organic phase to be more dense than water. The substrate is  introduced for a short time in the organic phase. This  softens its surface and allows the entanglement of the  hydrocarbon chains of the surfactant molecules and of the  surface molecules of the polymer substrate during the pulling  out of the substrate through the water-organic solvent  interface and the water phase. The two-phase system provides  an interface at which the surfactant molecules adsorb. This  highly oriented surfactant layer increases the efficiency of  the transfer of surfactant to the substrate. The interfacial  free energy between the modified polymer surface and water is  thus decreased below 1 dyne/cm. This can reduce the  deposition of proteins, cells and platelets on such surfaces.

This  research project is focused on identifying and characterizing the  transport pathways and regulatory mechanisms that bring the 5S  ribosomal RNA to the nucleolus for assembly into ribosomes. The  research will use mutants of the cloned 5S RNA genes and their  associated proteins to try to disrupt normal ribosome assembly or  function in order to discern how each component might function in  normal ribosome assembly. The mutated genes or their gene products  (5S RNAs or 5S RNA-binding proteins) will be microinjected in  Xenopus oocytes, and the gene products will be followed through the  cell by way of the radioisotopic labelling and/or specific  antibodies against the protein or nucleoprotein components. In  vitro exchange studies will be carried out with isolated nucleoli  and with isolated ribosomes, and the results will be verified in  vivo through the microinjection experiments.  %%%  Protein synthesis is a fundamental process of all living cells.  The machinery for protein synthesis is the ribosome, a complex  structure consisting of many individual macromolecular components,  both proteins and polyribonucleic acids (RNAs). The synthesis of  ribosomes is a complex process, since the synthesis of the  individual macromolecular components occurs in various parts of the  cell, and sometimes at different times, yet it is necessary to  bring all the different components together for assembly. The  protein components of the ribosome are themselves synthesized on  preexisting ribosomes, and this takes place in the cytoplasm. The  ribonucleic acids are synthesized in the nucleus, since they are  direct transcripts of the ribosomal genes. Three of the four RNA  molecules are synthesized in a specialized region of the nucleus  termed the nucleolus, first as a very long transcript which is  processed into the three smaller pieces. It is to the nucleolus  that all the other components are brought for assembly, including  the fourth and smallest RRNA molecule, termed \"5S.\" This 5S RNA is  synthesized in the nucleus, but not in the nucleolus. Prior  results from this laboratory have shown that, in Xenopus oocytes,  the 5S RNA is synthesized in advance of the other RRNA components,  and that after the 5S RNA is transcribed it is transported to the  cytoplasm, together with its own transcription factor (a protein  termed TFIIIA), and is stored there. Subsequently, it becomes  dissociated from TFIIIA and associates with a different protein,  L5, which is a ribosomal protein; the 5S RNA-L5 complex is then  transported back to the nucleus, specifically now to the nucleolus,  where it becomes assembled into the nascent ribosomes. This  project will address the mechanism and regulation of this  complicated nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. The work is of  significance not only for understanding ribosomal biogenesis, which  is itself a very important problem in biology, but also for  understanding nucleocytoplasmic trafficking in general, which as a  phenomenon is fundamental to much of eukaryotic cellular  regulation.",a9206668,5S RNA Transport,"October 1, 1992",$320667 (Estimated),Eve Ida Barak  MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"November 30, 1996 (Estimated)",Aimee H.

Relaxation and lower semicontinuity properties of nonconvex  bulk and interfacial energies will be obtained and singular  perturbation methods will be used in nonlinear elasticity to  resolve nonuniqueness of equilibria. These results will help us  understand and predict the surface structures and geometries of  crystals subjected to thermal or mechanical treatments.

Thermochemical equilibria for coherent two-phase alloys  when physical variables, such as composition, are taken into  account will be considered. This study will enable predicting  the dependence of equilibrium phase composition on the overall  composition and volume fraction.

Thus, it is important to evaluate the machinability of the design,  providing feedback so that the designer can change the design to  improve its machinability. For machining purposes, a part is often  considered to be a collection of machinable features. However,  often there can be several different interpretations of the same  part as different collections of machinable features. Each  interpretation corresponds to a different set of machining  operations, in a different order, with different machinability.  To determine the machinability of the part, all of these  alternatives should be generated and their machinability evaluated.  This research will develop ways to do this automatically. For  generating the alternative feature interpretations, the  investigator's will use an algebraic approach, in which new  interpretations will be produced via algebraic operations on old  interpretations. For evaluating the machinability of each feature,  the researchers will take into account the feature geometry,  tolerance requirements, surface finish requirements, and  statistical variations in the process capabilities. The  information provided by such an analysis can be used in several  ways: (1) To provide information to the manufacturing engineer  about alternative ways in which the part might be machined. This  information can be useful in developing process planning  alternatives depending on machine tool availability. (2) To  provide feedback to the designer identifying problems that may  arise with the machining.

They can consume a large proportion of bacterial  production, and convert material that is low in essential lipids  (bacterial biomass and detritus) into lipid-rich ciliate biomass.  How do consumers benefit nutritionally from these ciliates, and  what role do they play in the biochemical transformation of ciliate  carbon?   To investigate the nature of ciliate lipids and their fate and  importance in the marine food web Dr. Harvey and McManus will:   - identify and quantify ciliate lipids, especially ones that may  be useful as group-specific biomarkers in trophic studies.  - examine sources of lipids in the ciliate diet and follow how  ciliates assimilate and modify dietary lipids.  - measure the assimilation and transformation of ciliate lipids  by one of their principal consumers, copepods.   This project combines biochemical measurements with feeding  experiments. Detailed lipid analysis of a number of ciliate  species will first provide additional data on the ubiquity of the  unique compounds they have already observed. They will measure in  detail the role of diet on lipid content and distribution of  several representative bacterivorous ciliates. Finally, they will  conduct in-depth feeding experiments to follow the incorporation  and transformation of ciliate lipids by grazing copepods.

The motivation in building such  plants lies not only in the reduction of transportation and  inventory costs, but also for increasing the capability to  provide a steady supply of products, and for responding more  quickly to demand changes in each market. Thus, flexible  multiproduct plants offer the possibility of improving the  competitiveness of chemical companies.   Multiproduct plants can operate in batch or continuous mode,  or with a combination of the two. Typical examples of the  former include plants for manufacturing pharmaceuticals, food  and specialty chemicals; examples of the latter include plants  for manufacturing a number of polymer products, paper mills  and petroleum refineries. The main difference that arises in  multiproduct plants compared to large scale dedicated  continuous plants is that scheduling and production planning  play a major role in the operation of these plants. Another  issue is that uncertainties and fluctuations in the product  demands tend to be much greater in multiproduct plants.   This research deals with the development of systematic methods  for the design and scheduling of various types of flexible  multiproduct chemical processes that operate in the continuous  mode. The work involves the development of models and  solution techniques for the simultaneous design and scheduling  of plants that consist of a sequence of stages and that are  interconnected by intermediate inventory tanks. The basic  objective is to determine optimal trade-offs arising from the  selection of design variables, operating conditions,  sequencing of operations, length of production cycles and  inventory levels.

In the first, a problem of long standing,  finding tractable non-Gaussian analogs of the Kalman model and  filtering algorithm, is studied. Here a promising probability  structure is introduced that seems to produce sensible recursive  filtering algorithms for discrete data. The proposed work involves  the development and implementation of this model. In the second,  the problem of finding improved interval estimates of a finite  population mean or median is considered. It is well-known that  under simple random sampling without replacement with a moderate  sample from a skewed population, the usual interval estimates  perform poorly. The same can be true in stratified random sampling  when the sample sizes within the strata are small. Here a  noninformative Bayesian approach, which is based on a  generalization of the 'Polya posterior', is suggested as a method  for generating improved interval estimates.   The principal investigator is an expert in the theory of  finite sampling. His continued use of the Bayesian approach to  problems in this area and in the development of filtering  algorithms for discrete data is well worth pursuing.

These two goals can be achieved most effectively using  methods of DNA fingerprinting. Estimating average relatedness  among nestmates is of interest because female P. portalis nest  communally, with from 3 to 29 adult females per nest. Communal  nesting, the sharing of a single nest by more than one  reproductively active female, is an evolutionary stable form of  social interaction which is widespread in bees, but which has  received little attention by students of social evolution. While  many relatedness estimates exist for eusocial species, few data  exist for communal species. All behavioral evidence suggests  that nestmates in P. portalis are closely related, both because  nests are re-used for generations and because flightless males  mate with their female nestmates. In order to understand the  role of kin selection, and other factors, in shaping communal  societies, it is essential to accurately assess within nest  relatedness. Part two of the project focuses on the selective  factors underlying the origin of maintenance of dimorphic males  in P. portalis. Males in this species occur in two non-  overlapping morphs: a large-headed, flightless morph and a small-  headed, flight capable morph. Large-headed males mate with their  female nestmates immediately prior to oviposition and engage in  male-male battles which often lead to death of one combatant.  These observations suggest that the large-headed morph has arisen  as a result of sperm precedence that confers a last male mating  advantage. In order to test this hypotheses it will be necessary  to assess paternity of eggs produced in observation nests. The  two projects are related in that the female social behavior  establishes selective pressures on male mating behavior, and  intra-nest mating should lead to elevated levels to nestmate  relatedness.",a9201921,"PRF: Assessing the Nestmate Relatedness and Sperm Precedence in a Communal Bee, Perdita portalis, Using DNA Fingerprnting","July 1, 1992",$69600 (Estimated),Mark W.

We intend to proceed along three approaches in our  research effort: (i) Particle simulation. We plan to cooperate  with others on computer simulation, notably Dr. H. Okuda from  Princeton University. He is doing state-of-the-art computer  simulation of the physics of the magnetopause. (ii) A test  particle approach. Starting from M. Gorton's model,  perturbations of the magnetopause will allow us to calculate the  inductive electric field and the magnetopause currents. (iii)  Analysis of Experimental Data. Finally, we plan to take the  September 6, 1981 event as a primary test case for the theory and  modeling. On that unique occasion, DE-1 went outside the  magnetopause during a period of very high magnetospheric  compression while DE-2 traversed the foot of the field line on  several orbits.

Work includes the investigation of smoothing  properties for a large class of linear and nonlinear dispersive  evolution equations. Dispersive waves are characterized by the  property that the group velocity depends in a nontrivial way on  the wave number. An example would be Korteweg deVries equation.  The smoothing phenomenon refers to the observed behavior of  solutions of certain equations - they are smoother than their  initial conditions. The approach to this work is the use of the  commutator method together with scattering theory. One needs  microlocal versions of Sobolev weighted norms to replace the  standard norms which do not persist with time. Other research  directions include regularized determinants: the study of  variational formulas for the regularized determinants of elliptic  operators on Riemannian manifolds of dimension two; global  aspects of completely integrable Hamiltonian systems and the  Schrodinger operator on tori and Heisenberg manifolds.  Partial differential equations form the backbone of  mathematical modeling in the physical sciences. Phenomena which  involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials  and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are  expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships  between partial derivatives. The key role of mathematics is not  to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative  and quantitative meaning from them and validate methods  for expressing solutions.",a9204510,Mathematical Sciences: Smoothing of Dispersive Waves,"August 15, 1992",$35000 (Estimated),John V.

The enormous database of geochemical,  petrographic, stratigraphic and paleontological information  provides a unique opportunity to understand the tectonomagmatic  framework within which large quantities of felsic subduction-  related ash was injected into the stratosphere and widely  distributed across large portions of Baltica, Avalonia and  Laurentia. It is clear that major centers of volcanism changed  along the margins of Iapetus from Ordovician to Silurian time, but  the timing and location of these centers is not well understood.  We will look particularly at what we now believe to be a single,  ultraplinian eruptive event which deposited ash on both continental  margins of Iapetus and may have been derived from the same arc  source as the Ammonoosuc Volcanics of southern New England.  Resolving these questions will provide new clarifying information  about the tectonic events affecting the margin of Iapetus.  Further, we propose to evaluate the event-stratigraphic and  biologic implications of these events by selected, detailed studies  of widespread Ordovician and Silurian K-bentonites using isotopic  ages, chemical fingerprinting, and faunal studies.

During the last ten to  fifteen years it has become increasingly clear that these issues  are of great importance to the interactive social sciences and in  related areas; and that when there is more than one person, new  problems arise which require treatment going beyond the one-  person treatment. Roughly, these problems have to do with what  the protagonists know about each other's knowledge and about the  system as a whole, and what can and cannot be said about these  matters within the system. These problems manifest themselves in  various ways, depending on the formal model being used. For  example within the standard \"partition\" model of knowledge, the  problem is usually posed by asking, where do the particular  partitions that are assumed come from, and does each player  \"know\" the partitions of the others. This project explores these  matters systematically and in detail. The concepts of subjective  probability and rationality in multi-person contexts will also be  treated. Applications to the foundations of interactive decision  making, game theory, computer science and biology will be  considered.   The results of this research will be presented in a monograph.  The monograph will be divided into three or four parts. The  first part is devoted to the partition model of interactive  knowledge theory. A syntactical or propositional approach to  knowledge partitions is adopted by the investigator in contrast  to the usual hierarchical method. The second part applies the  same approach used for pure knowledge systems to probablistic  \"belief\" systems. In addition to elementary propositions,  propositional connectives, and knowledge operators, probability  operators will be used. The rest of the monograph includes the  following: irrationality, and/or lack of common knowledge of  rationality; applications to equilibrium analysis in normal as  well as extensive form games; games played by Turing machines;  and applications to computer systems and biological systems,  where the term \"knowledge\" needs to be properly interpreted.",a9209277,On the Foundation of Interactive Knowledge,"August 15, 1992",$68422 (Estimated),"Daniel H.

This  research investigates task-level planning for autonomous agents,  such as mobile robots, that function in an uncertain environment.  These robots typically have very approximate, inaccurate, or  minimal models of the environment. For example, although the  geometry of its environment is crucial to determining its  performance, a mobile robot might only have a partial, or local  \"map\" of the world. The research will investigate an approach  whereby the robot attempts to acquire the necessary information  about the world by planning a series of experiments using the  robot's sensors and actuators, and building data structures based  on the robot's observations of these experiments.

The first will be expression of the full length  clone, pCGS11N, which contains the coding information for avian  liver glutamine synthetase, in expression vectors such as pKK223 or  various derivatives thereof. Of special concern will be a  characterization of the expression product, especially its  conformation. Preliminary results indicate the expression product  may aggregate. Since this is likely to render it import-  incompetent, conditions that prevent aggregation and also keep the  protein in an unfolded configuration will be established. The  second major objective will be to establish an in vitro system in  which glutamine synthetase is imported into isolated mitochondria.  If necessary, the original technique of presenting isolated  mitochondria with freshly translated synthetase will be used,  although the use of the pure expression product is now preferable  and is required to establish species- and tissue-specific cytosolic  import factors.  %%%  Seventy-five percent of land vertebrates utilize a uricotelic-type  mechanism for detoxifying ammonia formed during hepatic amino acid  catabolism. Ammonia, formed via the glutamate dehydrogenase  reaction, is converted by glutamine synthetase to the amide  function of glutamine which then exits to the cytosol where it is  utilized for uric acid synthesis. In the ureotelic mechanism,  utilized by mammals and some adult amphibians, ammonia is converted  to citrulline in the mitochondria, which then exits to the cytosol  to be converted to urea. What these two pathways have in common is  that in each case, the ammonia-detoxifying mechanisms are directed  toward converting ammonia formed in the mitochondrial matrix to a  form that does not bind protons during transit of the inner  mitochondrial membrane and therefore does not uncouple oxidative  phosphorylation. What is particularly interesting is that, in  ureotelic vertebrates (e.g., mammals), the enzyme glutamine  synthetase is only found in the cytosol, never in the mitochondria,  whereas in the uricotelic sauropsid vertebrates (reptiles and  birds) the enzyme is localized to mitochondria in the liver but is  cytosolic in other tissues such as neural tissue. A putative  mitochondrial targeting sequence in the avian enzyme, not present  in the mammalian enzyme, has been identified. However, the primary  amino acid sequences of the avian liver (mitochondrial) and neural  tissue (cytosolic) forms are identical, raising the question of how  the differential targeting occurs.

The future research will address these two  questions 1) by obtaining larvae in the open ocean and ascertain  experimentally whether or not these larvae are competent to  metamorphose, (2) by maintaining larvae in the laboratory to  determine whether individuals that would not metamorphose in the  sea eventually become competent to metamorphose, and 3) by  determining whether or not teleplanic larvae are physiologically  capable of further growth given adequate phytoplankton  concentrations or alternatively whether growth stasis, i.e., a  quasi-holoplanktonic state, is achieved.",a9201499,Limits to the Prolonged Planktonic Life Among Larvae of Tropical Benthic Invertebrates and Its Biogeographic Consequences,"May 1, 1992",$54139 (Estimated),OCE DIVISION OF OCEAN SCIENCES  GEO DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES,"September 30, 1994 (Estimated)",Rudolf S.

The underlying  reason for this is that to be  applicable to \"large\" classes of  process models, the \"parameterized  design models\" upon which  \"certainty equivalence control\" is  based, almost always have points in  their parameter spaces at which the  design model is unstabilizable -  and at such points certainty  equivalence controller design via  \"design model stabilization\" is  impossible. We propose to deal with  this problem by exploiting the  special capabilities if identifier-  based adaptive controllers  employing switching. We propose to  study switching algorithms of two  different types. The first, called  \"hysteresis switching\" has already  been used to successfully resolve  several long standing problems from  classical model reference adaptive  control. The second, called  \"cyclic switching,\" is in an  earlier stage of development, but  has the potential of yielding  adaptive controllers with  capabilities well beyond those  existing algorithms. Ever since  the introduction of tuning error  normalization by Edgart in 1978,  the concept has been vigorously  exploited. One of the main  benefits of normalization is that  it enables one to obtain  stabilizing adaptive controllers  which are very much simpler in  structure than are algorithms which  do not use normalization. It is  largely for this reason that tuning  error normalization in one form or  another has been so widely utilized  in parameter adaptive control. On  the other hand, it has recently  been observed that, in spite of  their relative complexity,  algorithms not using error  normalization offer several clear  advantages over algorithms which  do. We propose to further develop  the principles of normalization-  free adaptive control, to study the  capabilities of normalization-free  algorithms, and to compare their  performance with the performance of  algorithms of the normalization-  dependent type.",a9206021,Adaptive Stabilization Theory,"April 1, 1993",$190251 (Estimated),Radhakisan S.

Geometric group  theory seeks to tie together combinatorial and geometric properties  of geometric isometry groups. The theory is burgeoning at the  hands of Gromov, Epstein, Thurston, Holt, Bestvina, Feighn, Mess,  Paterson, Gersten, Short, Shapiro, Parry, Floyd, Baumslag, Casson,  Brick, Stallings, a whole school of continental mathematicians,  Cannon, and others. The theory has produced the notions of  automatic group, negatively curved group, complex of groups, almost  convex groups, combable groups, isoperimetric and isodiametric  inequalities for groups. Amid these many topics, Cannon, his  students, and coworkers are currently concentrating on a cluster of  projects related to the existence of hyperbolic structures on 3-  manifolds. Is the generic finitely presented group negatively  curved, as claimed without explicit proof by Gromov? Does every  negatively curved closed 3-manifold admit a Riemannian metric of  constant negative curvature? Can negative curvature be recognized  algorithmically? Can the space at infinity be recognized  algorithmically? Can potential constant curvature be recognized  algorithmically? Cannon is using as the basis for these studies  his combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem developed during the  previous projects, the related work by Parry, and the computer  Programs of Epstein and his collaborators.  Groups are the appropriate algebraic structures for describing  the notion of symmetry with precision. For this reason they play  an extensive role in geometry (and topology). While the more usual  interaction between group theory and geometry is the use of  algebraic computations involving groups to prove theorems about  geometric objects possessing symmetry, there is a very significant  mathematical subdiscipline in which the roles are reversed and our  intuition about geometric objects assists us in conjecturing and  proving theorems about associated groups. A fascinating recent  development is the influence of the computer in all this. Not only  is it the ubiquitous timesaver that everyone knows, enabling one to  undertake computations that would otherwise be too formidable, but  it has actually influenced the questions in geometric group theory  in a more fundamental way. Certain classes of groups have been  defined in terms of the types of hypothetical machines that would  be able to perform certain computations about them. Real hardware  is not involved in this, and the same definitions could have been  conceived long ago, but they were not, for the existence of  computing machines has influenced the way we look at the world, the  types of questions we ask about it, the kinds of properties that we  find interesting.",a9204502,Mathematical Sciences: Geometric Topology and the Fundamental Group,"August 1, 1992",$102900 (Estimated),Ralph M.

Polymers  are used as flocculants or stabilizers in water and waste  treatment, mineral processing, coal-water slurry  stabilization, paint production, food colloid stabilization,  separation of bacterial suspensions, paper making, brewing,  ceramics fabrication, pharmaceutical preparation, and  agrochemical formulation. The stability, mobility, and  chemical reactively of colloidal particles naturally present  in groundwater and other aquatic systems are strongly  controlled by surface coatings of organic molecules. Since  these particles influence the transport of chemical or  radioactive contaminants and the survival of pathogenic  microorganisms, the presence of organic-coated colloids must  be accounted for in models that predict the fate of hazardous  wastes in the environment.   This research seeks to clarify the mechanisms by which  surface-adsorbed polymers influences colloid stability in  aqueous systems.

Two of these, stunted (stuA) and medusa  (medA), are required to establish correct patterns of cell  differentiation and the organization of these new cell types into  the aerial reproductive structure. The specific goals of this  project are: 1) to determine cis-acting regulatory elements  required for transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of  stuA expression, 2) to isolate genes encoding trans-acting factors  effecting stuA gene expression, 3) to use antibodies directed  against Stu A protein for biochemical characterization and in situ  localization, 4) to isolate genes whose expression is dependent  upon StuA function nad 5) to physically characterize the medA gene.",a9208043,Cell Pattern Formation in Aspergillus Nidulans,"July 15, 1992",$320509 (Estimated),Judith A.

A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique will be  used, based on 15N spectral editing of the one-dimensional proton  spectrum. A single peptide NH will be 15N-labeled by chemical  synthesis of the peptide, and 15N spin echo difference spectroscopy  will be used to give the 1H spectrum of the single 15N-labeled  peptide NH. A trial experiment demonstrating the feasibility of  this approach has been made. The new method will be used to test  the basic assumptions of helix-random coil transition theory, and  also to provide background information about exchange rates of  amide protons in single alpha-helices, for use in interpreting data  on protein folding intermediates.  %%%  The proposed experiments will provide a new technique for obtaining  structural information about short peptides, for example, when the  peptide is complexed with a specific receptor. Currently there is  wide interest in \" peptide libraries\", both in the biotechnology  field and in biomedical science generally. Methodologies have been  developed for synthesizing astronomical numbers of different short  peptide sequences and then for selecting a small number of  sequences that can bind specifically to a receptor in a signal  transduction pathway.

These  effects are usually complicated by  the three-dimensional aspects of  the problem, including impact with  coastal structures and propagation  over the nearshore bathymetry; to  which these long waves are highly  responsive. Most of the existing  research on tsunami run-up is  primarily two-dimensional: There  is a need to make advances in  experimental and numerical  techniques so as to understand the  three-dimensional features of  tsunami run-up.   This research program is a  coordinated effort among several  researchers to investigate this  phenomenon through innovative  combinations of modern experimental  techniques, mathematical theories  and numerical models.

In addition to  function theoretic methods, the work exploits the deep  connections of the subject with partial differential equations.  Among the most challenging open questions in several complex  variables is that of understanding the orthogonal projection of  functions (with finite quadratic norm) defined on a domain in the  space of several complex variables onto the subspace of  holomorphic functions. This is known as the Bergman projection.  The primary goal is to determine when the projection preserves  differentiability up to the boundary. A number of solutions have  been determined under various finiteness conditions on the  domain. The current work will pursue a line of investigation  involving the construction of special vector fields which has led  to a broad class of results. The ultimate goal is to use these  techniques to establish a general theory of regularity on domains  of infinite type. The continuity of the Bergman projection and  the related d-bar Neumann operator in spaces other than quadratic  Sobolev spaces will also be studied.  Since the Bergman projections are not always regular, there  is a need to determine obstructions to regularity as well as  conditions for its presence. It is known that the topology of  the set of points of infinite type is not sufficient to give  complete information about obstructions.

Major geologic  opportunities are offered by the Pliocene Hadar Formation because  of its setting along the tectonic margin between the Ethiopian  Plateau and the Afar Depression with an outstanding badlands  exposure that extends well beyond the studied site of Hadar. We  will build a facies model of deposition for the formation pegged  to a very good stratigraphic/geochronologic framework. The  previous sedimentological work stressed stratigraphic correlation  and suggested only very generalized environments of deposition.  Being just 50 km east of the presently 2.5 km high Plateau  escarpment, these Pliocene deposits remarkably consist of 70% mud  units and only 30% sands. Most of the muds are massive with  incipient arid paleosols. Minor laminated mud sequences were  deposited in a lake we hypothesize transgressed from the east  (central Afar). While the massive mud sand sequence seems to  represent deposits of a meandering river the sands are too  laterally extensive and too gradational into cobble conglomerates  (westward toward the escarpment) to be explained by presently  available meandering stream models.  By delineating and mapping detailed subfacies, especially in  the sands and by cataloging lateral and vertical sequences and the  first systematic paleocurrent data, we can assess sandflat versus  various channelized flow options. For the muds we hope to  delineate paleosols of varying maturity, and whether the lake was  saline or fresh. Careful facies mapping along the several  isochronal tuff surfaces will provide environmental mosaic  time-slices across Hadar. This research should provide: (1) a  significant segment of the history of the Afar tectonic boundary;  (2) knowledge of the environments where the hominids lived and were  preserved, and a strategy for exploring for them in the vast  exposures east and west of Hadar, and; (3) a contribution toward  a general facies model for thick rapid alluvial deposition where  sheets sands exist in association with thick muds.",a9206515,"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Sedimentology and Environment of Deposition of the Hadar Formation, Ethiopia","July 15, 1992",$75661 (Estimated),Christopher G.

It will support  postdocs and graduate students in Modern Analysis at the  University of California at Berkeley. The research supported by  this award will deal with various aspects of Modern Analysis  including the representation theory of Lie groups, the theory of  operator algebras, and ergodic theory.  As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries  inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has  had a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in  analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical physics,  especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.  The theory of operator algebras begins with the notion of  operator, which can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices  of complex numbers. Special types of operators are often put  together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example, they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn  is currently being used to study the structure of DNA, and they  are of fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which  is becoming increasingly important in physics. Ergodic theory in  general concerns understanding the average behavior of systems  whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in  microscopic detail. Under the heading \"dynamics can be placed  the modern theory of how groups of abstract transformations act  on smooth spaces.

Convergence, i.e.  termination of this method produces finitistic proofs of  combinatorial identities and numerical realizations of provable  Sigma-zero-one-formulas. The problem of convergence was treated by  von Neumann (1927) for quantifier-free induction and by Ackermann  (1940) for the system of first-order arithmetic. The problem for  analysis remained open until very recently, when it was settled by  Mints (1990). Mints now intends to investigate convergence  problems for other systems where the problem is still open,  including the following: 1) predicative analysis and predicatively  reducible systems, 2) stronger subsystems of analysis whose proof-  theoretic ordinal is known, 3) the theory of types, 4) full  analysis with the axiom of choice, 5) Zermelo set theory and  possibly stronger systems.  Proof theory examines questions about proofs that lie to one  side of their correctness. Correctness is understood and taken for  granted. For example, what axioms are required, all the axioms of  a system or only a proper subset? Indeed, certain axioms are  particularly critical in such studies, the necessity of employing  the so-called Axiom of Choice, involving orders of infinity greater  than that of the set of all the positive integers, 1, 2, 3, ...,  being considered particularly interesting. Other strong axioms of  infinity often play this role too. In another direction, one can  ask of a proof that shows that something or other exists whether it  provides an explicit recipe for constructing the thing shown to  exist. Proofs which do are called \"constructive,\" and others,  \"non-constructive.\" A particularly intriguing part of proof theory  concerns itself with whether a non-constructive proof can be  reworked in some automatic way into a constructive one. It turns  out that the answer depends on the theory being studied. The  investigator has shown that a method known as the Hilbert  substitution method can be used to turn any non-constructive proof  in a certain formulation of analysis into a constructive one by  essentially turning a crank, and he would like to know if the  argument he gave can be adapted to obtain the analogous result for  certain other mathematical systems.",a9206976,Mathematical Sciences: Convergence Properties of Hilbert's Substitution Method,"September 1, 1992",$60000 (Estimated),Ralph M.

In this proposal we hope to  provide direct evidence for the \"rotating myosin head\" hypothesis  of Huxley (1969), the widely accepted working model for the  contractile mechanism. Our approach is to correlate the structural  changes of the myosin head (orientation and mobility) with force  production (mechanical cycle) and the utilization of ATP  (biochemical cycle). In order to delineate physical changes taking  place during different steps of the contractile cycle, steady-  state equilibria will be perturbed mechanically and biochemically  including \"trapping\" the cycle at certain steps.   The orientation and mobility of muscle proteins will be measured  using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) following  the labeling of these proteins with paramagnetic probes. EPR is  uniquely suited for this purpose because it is site-specific and  it is sensitive to static orientation and rotational mobility of  proteins.   We have just developed a number of computational methods to extract  the myosin head orientation (rather than the spin probe  orientation) from EPR spectra.

The project  involves the generation of multiple cDNAs of CD44 isoforms, the  transfection of cells with each of these cDNAs, and analyses of  consequent cell behavior. Post-translational modifications of CD44,  primarily in the form of glycosylation, apparently affect the  binding specificity for the protein. This project also focuses on  changes in the glycosylation in the various isoforms of CD44, and  the consequent changes in adhesion functions for the molecule.  %%%  The interaction of endothelial cell glycoproteins and their  complementary leukocyte receptors directs the extravasation of  lymphocytes into inflammatory sites. CD44 is the principal receptor  for hyaluronic acid, is constitutively expressed on leukocytes, and  mediates both intercellular attachment and extracellular matrix  adhesion. CD44 also interacts with intracellular cytoskeletal  elements, and thus, may provide an important link in coordinating  extracellular attachments and subsequent changes in intracellular  organization. The glycosylation of CD44 appears to play an  important role in the binding specificity for the protein.

In the first part of this project, he intends to put the  knot signature into the framework of instanton invariants of 3-  manifolds. Considered in the context of an equivariant Floer  theory, the signature invariant is expected to provide a new  insight into some old problems in knot theory, e.g., the estimate  of the unknotting number. In the second part, he will explore the  relationship established between knot polynomials and Vassiliev's  knot invariants. He anticipates finding a combinatorial  construction of knot invariants from Vassiliev's initial data.  These knot invariants determine essentially all generalized Jones  polynomials derived via quantum groups. He also hopes to get some  information about the outstanding problem of finding non-trivial  knots with trivial Jones polynomials from Vassiliev's knot  invariants.  Knots are rather elementary geometric objects whose really  interesting properties are topological. By this we mean that two  geometric knots do not differ in an interesting way if one of them  can be transformed to look just like the other without cutting or  untying it, just by pushing its string about to rearrange the  crossings. Topologists say that they are two different geometric  realizations of the same topological knot. Nevertheless, it is not  a trivial matter to recognize when one complicated geometric knot  is topologically different from another, rather than just a  different geometric realization. This problem can be addressed by  computing certain numbers or polynomials which are called  \"topological invariants,\" meaning that they always have the same  value for different geometric realizations of the same topological  knot. The problem would be reduced to pure algebra if there were  one invariant which also always had different values for geometric  realizations of different topological knots, but life is not so  simple -- no single invariant achieves this ideal, nor even all the  known invariants taken together. It is therefore valuable to  investigate new invariants, some of the most useful being those  inspired in recent years by ideas from quantum physics. In  particular, applications of knot theory to the biology of long  strands of DNA have drawn upon knowledge of these newer invariants.",a9201091,Mathematical Sciences: Knot Theory: New Invariants and TheirTopology,"July 15, 1992",$129100 (Estimated),Ralph M.

Since most of  the poor live in rural areas, national and state governments have  directed their economic development policies for alleviating  poverty to rural localities. The relative success of alleviating  poverty is geographically variant and seems to be related to the  constraining and enabling effects of the local ruling class.  This project will attempt to answer why programs for the  alleviation of poverty in rural India are more successful in some  villages and states than in others, and it offers a theoretical  framework for evaluating this geographical variation. Two  specific rural development programs will be examined. A  multivariate analysis will establish the degree to which sub-  districts with high levels of success in implementation of these  programs have lower incidence of poverty. Areas of very high and  very low success rates will be studied in detail in terms of the  relations among local state officials, local ruling classes, and  party leaders, and local organizations representing lower  classes. Unstructured interviews and data from local archives  will serve to illustrate that local variation in policy  implementation success rates depends upon local social and  political structures.

Previous research has recognized the importance of obtaining  quantitative data on the weathering rates of rocks. While  research has shown that lichen overgrowth disrupts and erodes the  substrate, little quantitative data have been collected on this  weathering phenomenon. Lichens represent the dominant biological  species on eight percent of the Earth's surface. Their  ubiquitousness may establish lichens as a greater pedogenetic  factor than previously understood. This project will investigate  the quantifiable effect of lichen overgrowth on substrate surface  weathering , removal, and potential pedogenesis. Research will  be conducted in the Petra region of Jordan to determine lichen-  induced erosion in controlled circumstances from the late  Pleistocene to the present. Regression models will be developed  and tested to determine rates of weathering under differing  conditions of time, exposure of the rock to sunlight, proximity  to surface, location of water flows, and other environmental  variables. Radiocarbon dating and timing of human carvings in  sandstone will be used to establish when weathering took place.  This study should fill several missing niches in the  weathering literature by connecting the factors responsible for  lichen growth, by providing information on the process by which  lichen alters rock, and by estimating the quantity of weathered  by-products. Knowledge of the quantity of substrate weathering  over time should inform archaeological research on lichen induced  alteration of petroglyphs and geoglyphs, pedological research on  substrate change into pedogenetic material, lichenology through  the development of a potential dryland lichenometric growth  curve, and geography through an assessment of spatial variability  of weathering rates.",a9205055,Doctoral Dissertation Research in Geography and Regional Science,"July 15, 1992",$6400 (Estimated),"Brian Holly  BCS DIVISION OF BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE SCI SBE DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","December 31, 1994 (Estimated)",Thomas R.

Part I of the  research, the first of two parts, focuses on a biaxial  constitutive test with two additional, innovative, features: (i)  the capacity to continuously measure the speed of sound in  deforming granular material as a function of the accummulated  deformation in the sample and the direction of propagation of the  waves and (ii) the capacity of continuously measure density  changes and particle velocities with sophisticated X-ray imaging  equipment. The goals of Part I include (i) experimentally, to  construct and operate the apparatus and (ii) computationally, to  simulate deformation of a sample in the apparatus, including  superimposed acoustic waves, up to and beyond the formation of  shear bands. Mathematical analysis has a major supporting role  to play in extracting constitutive information from the  experimental data and in developing an appropriate numerical  scheme.  Part II of the research consists of several subprojects  which probe more deeply phenomena discovered in the previous  grant period.

Regarding applications, this project has been most closely  associated with the flow of granular materials inside silos.  However, there are many geophysical occurrences of granular  materials, and the rich supply of constitutive information on  sound propagatioyn to be gathered from this project will be  relevant for these.

This pooling provides a robustness in that after  the data are obtained, decisions can be taken without knowing which  prior opinion was used. Also, it suggests asymptotic theories  which use sets of probabilities rather than a single probability to  represent a belief can share some of the properties of a strict  Bayesian theory. Less familiar, and the focus of this project, is  the phenomenon called 'dilation' for sets of probabilities.  Dilation occurs when, regardless of the evidence, the set of  posterior probabilities for a given even properly contains the set  of prior probabilities for that event, as in, for example,  sequential decision making. Thus, dilation is the opposite  phenomenon to the merging of sets of probabilities. This project  raises sever questions about the importance of dilation for  sequential decisions, and in particular, for the Harsanyi-Selten  theory of sequential games.

Although the importance  of transcriptional, mechanisms is understood, the role of post-  translational controls is only beginning to be elucidated. Several  observations suggest that the iridovirus, frog virus 3 (FV3), may  be an excellent model in which to study post-transcriptional/  translational gene regulation: (a) the steady state level of FV3  early messages does not decline in infected cells, whereas host  transcripts are rapidly degraded; (b) FV3 messages are translated  more efficiently than host or heterologous messages in vitro; (c)  early mRNA is not degraded and, after extraction, actively directs  protein synthesis in vitro; and (d) late viral messages, which are  major gene products in vivo, are translated poorly in extracts from  uninfected cells. Taken together these phenomena suggest that FV3  gene expression is controlled, at least in part, at the post-  transcriptional/translational level.  %%%  In this proposal, the nature of putative post transcriptional/  translational controls will be explored. To accomplish this, two  specific aims have been established. Sp.

In inducing such a code children must use  information available in the speech that they hear and the events  that they witness in combination with preprogrammed constraints  on syntactic hypotheses. The process of induction has come to be  called \"bootstrapping\" in the acquisition literature.   Previously, the speech streem has been largely overlooked as a  potential source of information about linguistic structure.  Recently, however, an increasing number of scholars in a range of  disciplines have begun to investigate the relationship between  input speech and the acquisition of syntax. These researchers  include theoretical and computational linguists, acousticians,  speech pathologists, and psychologists and cognitive scientists  specializing in speech perception and language acquisition.   Unfortunately, most of these researchers work in relative  isolation, having little opportunity for contact with those from  other disciplines. It is time to bring them together, that they  might share insights and chart directions for future research in  this vitally important new area of research.

This data set is a subset of a  larger one collected by French scientists in 1990. This part of  the African margin is known as the Ivory Coast-Ghana Margin, and is  an example of a passive margin formed through transform rifting.  The crustal structures developed during transform rifting are  relatively poorly understood. Seismic refraction data offer one of  the best means of determining crustal thicknesses and structures  resulting from this process. Information derived from the seismic  refraction data analysis will also be used as part of a site survey  for upcoming ODP activities in the area.  %%%  When continents rift apart, they may do so through divergent (major  direction of motion perpendicular to continent-continent boundary  line) or transform (major direction of motion parallel to  continent-continent boundary line) processes. The latter process  has not been studied in as much detail as the former, and is  relatively poorly understood. The rifting record is contained in  now-buried and submerged structures within passive margins, or  trailing edges of continents.

Most arguments about the evolution of  dispersal patterns assume that there is significant genetic  variation for these traits and genetically covary with other traits  that are influenced by natural selection. A major difficulty in  understanding the evolution of dispersal patterns has been the  inability to quantify individual differences in those biological  parameters contributing to dispersal potential. In the marine  slipper snail, Crepidula fornicata, the principal biological trait  governing dispersal capacity is the duration of a free-swimming  larval stage. Larval of Crepidula must develop in the plankton for  one to several weeks before becoming capable of metamorphosing to  the sedentary juvenile stage. This period of obligatory dispersal  can now be quantified for individual larvae. We propose to  determine the quantitative genetic covariance with other larval and  post-metamorphic traits that have been previously proposed to  influence the development of metamorphic competence and fitness  variation.

(i) Scharlemann intends to apply the new  research tools of \"thin position,\" combinatorics of surface  intersections, and sutured manifold theory to several problems in  the theory of knots and graphs in 3-space and of Heegaard  splittings of 3-manifolds. Of particular interest are methods for  determining and characterizing knotting of graphs in 3-manifolds,  for applying these tools to the graphs which arise naturally in  Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds, and, in the relatively simple  case in which the graphs consist of simple closed curves,  understanding how the topology changes under a process called Dehn  surgery. (ii) Long plans to examine several interrelated questions  in the theory of low-dimensional manifolds, braid groups, and  representation varieties. The specifics concern representations of  the fundamental groups of 3-manifolds and applications of these to  boundary slopes and Property P, as well as the braid groups and  their representations. (iii) Cooper intends to study ties of low-  dimensional topology to hyperbolic geometry. The connection  between incompressible surfaces in knot complements and the Newton  polygons of the SL2(C) knot polynomial provides a method of getting  at deep information about the topology of knot complements. The  hyperbolic gluing equations for a knot complement provide another  means to approach the same problem. Hodgson's formula for the  hyperbolic volume form provides a closed 1-form on any curve given  by a polynomial in the longitude and meridian eigenvalues. The  exactness of this volume form on a curve arising from a knot puts  strong conditions on which polynomials arise this way. Following  these leads, Cooper expects to find mutant knots with distinct  SL2(C) polynomials, even without being able to calculate these  polynomials explicitly.  Knots are rather elementary geometric objects whose really  interesting properties are topological. By this we mean that two  geometric knots do not differ in an interesting way if one of them  can be transformed to look just like the other without cutting or  untying it, just by pushing its string about to rearrange the  crossings. Nevertheless, it is not a trivial matter to recognize  when one complicated geometric knot is topologically different from  another, rather than just a different geometric realization. This  problem can be addressed by computing certain numbers or  polynomials which are called \"topological invariants,\" meaning that  they always have the same value for different geometric  realizations of the same topological knot. The problem would be  reduced to pure algebra if there were one invariant which also  always had different values for geometric realizations of different  topological knots, but life is not so simple -- no single invariant  achieves this ideal, nor even all the known invariants taken  together. It is therefore valuable to investigate new invariants,  some of the most useful being those inspired in recent years by  ideas from quantum physics. In particular, applications of knot  theory to the biology of long strands of DNA have drawn upon  knowledge of these newer invariants.",a9203522,Mathematical Sciences: Knotting in 3-Manifolds,"August 1, 1992",$193200 (Estimated),Ralph M.

Bactris is widespread throughout the neotropics,  from Mexico south to Bolivia, and also in the Caribbean. The  Amazon basin contains the greatest concentration of species.

The current  consensus of the research community is that IPA is  an effective tool, but quite limited in the range of  systems to which it can be applied. For example, it  is generally inapplicable to systems with multiple  classes of customers or systems with finite-capacity  buffers. But these features are central in many  applications. Thus IPA is widely regarded as an  interesting technique, but not practically useful. We  claim that this is incorrect and that IPA can be  applied quite generally. We have developed  theoretical support for this claim; the purpose of  this research is to translate this theory into a  practical \"machinery\" for implementing IPA. Our  approach is based on constructing continuous  measure-changing mappings on the sample path  space using an appropriate representation  (construction) of the process. A key element is that  we require continuity only for the performance  measure of interest, rather than an entire class of  performance measures. This allows a substantial  weakening of the existing conditions for the  applicability of IPA.

Included  are efforts to prove sharp norm-local smoothing estimates for the  wave equation in two dimensions, improving those obtained for  dispersive equations. Newly designed methods of microlocal  analysis will play a major role here. A primary application  envisioned concerns embedding results for the spherical wave  equation, establishing regularity properties of periodic  solutions to nonlinear wave equations and possibly proving local  decay estimates for solutions to initial value problems for  hyperbolic operators with a potential.  A second project involves the Lebesgue and Hardy space  mapping properties of Fourier-Airy operators and efforts to prove  sharp estimates for solutions to the wave equation in manifolds  with geodesically concave or convex boundaries.

At a  microscale, weathering contributes as part of the geomorphic  system, and an important objective of weathering research is the  development of models that explain and predict rates of chemical  reactions at the earth's surface. Quartz is among the most  common of terrestrial minerals, and it is regarded as one of the  most resistant to chemical weathering.

Field analysis combined with laboratory  microanalytical techniques will be used to quantify the physical  and chemical characteristics of quartz decrystallization. These  characteristics will be compared with time, temperature,  moisture, geochemical environment, biochemical environment,  geomorphology, and scale by means of statistical tests.

Small bats will  primarily be used because they are uniquely suited for revealing  the processes of ventilatory control under these conditions. The  extreme energetic demands of flight provide a system in which to  probe the upper limits of mammalian respiratory function. In  addition, the ability of small bats to reduce their body  temperature and metabolism through torpor permits the exploration  of ventilatory control when operating in its most reduced extreme.  Exploring ventilatory control processes in whole animals is often  thwarted by the experimental process itself, because ventilatory  control is subject to conscious override. However, a further  advantage of torpor is that it provides a state in which  ventilatory processes may be investigated free from conscious  interference, thus assuring dependable data. Experiments will be  performed using a variety of innovative techniques specially  designed for bats. This study will help elucidate physiological  control mechanisms regulating 1) unusually low and high metabolic  states, 2) different patterns of ventilation, and 3) the adaptation  to environmental changes.

The period of thermal  stratification is a time during which the intricacies of larval cod vertical and areal distributions may hold important implications for survival and ultimately recruitment. This project will utilize a new technique of otolith analyses (Sr/Ca ratios), which has recently been developed, to hindcast the temperature histories, and hence distributional histories (that is from the time of hatching to capture), of individual cod larvae collected in various  hydrographic regimes in the Georges Bank area. The technique will be advanced by employing a new technology, electron energy loss spectroscopy, which will increase the resolution of the Sr/Ca technique to a level capable of resolving sub-daily temperature histories. These analyses could reveal diel vertical migrations into or through a thermocline. Larval cod are believed to be more closely associated with the stratified waters on the sides of Georges Bank than the tidally mixed waters on top of the Bank, and are transported around Georges Bank and to the southwest with the residual circulation. The  abundances of their zooplankton prey are also more abundant on the stratified side of the thermal front in early spring, and the larvae are often associated with the depth of maximum prey abundance in the thermocline. Later in the year the late larvae and early juveniles are on the top of the Bank, where zooplankton densities become greater than on the flanks. The exact nature of  the vertical and areal distributions of the larvae in relation to mixed and stratified waters may be very important with regard to horizontal transport processes, temperature effects on growth, and the availability of zooplankton prey items. This project will employ new technology to examine the distributions of cod larvae a nd will form a collaborative link with an already-funded study (NOAA) that focuses on the physics of the vernal stratification process as it relates to the complete suite of zooplankton, and the distribution, growth and condition of cod and haddock larvae, thus making for a strong interdisciplinary program. ***",a9202061,Distribution and Survival of Cod Larvae in Relation to Hydrography on Georges Bank,"July 1, 1992",$153406 (Estimated),OCE DIVISION OF OCEAN SCIENCES  GEO DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES,"December 31, 1993 (Estimated)",David W.

Since GIS  have become important tools for storing and analyzing spatially  referenced information and have many practical applications in  economic, social, and environmental planning, it is important  that the configuration of knowledge in GIS accurately reflects  the ways in which humans cognize space and internally represent  environments. This research project poses the question of  whether a cognitive representation of space is an internalized  geographic information system. It will determine the degree to  which selected processes involved in compiling and using GIS are  similar to those involved in compiling and using cognitive maps.  Emphasis will be placed on the type of reasoning and the  inference required in both cognitive mapping and GIS and on how  such processes can be understood and interpreted by people.  Experiments will be designed to evaluate human competence in  performing such activities as recognizing adjacency,  connectivity, network membership, path selection criteria,  conducting analysis and compilation of overlay and compression  procedures, and undertaking neighborhood delineation and  regionalization activities.

dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_06/a9206051.txt,0203000 Health  61 Life Science Biological,"In eukaryotes, newly replicated DNA assembles with histones and  regulatory and general transcription factors to form nucleosomes  and transcription initiation complexes. Competition between the  binding of regulatory factors to DNA and assembly of the same DNA  into nucleosomes may play a key role in establishing and  maintaining patterns of differential gene expression. The goal of  this proposal is to help elucidate mechanisms which govern the  outcome of this competition in vivo and guide studies of  transcription using chromatin templates in vitro. Initial studies  demonstrated that heat shock factor (HSF) can activate  transcription while bound to a nucleosome in Saccharomyces  cerevisiae. This result suggests that the position which a factor  binding site adopts when it is packaged in a nucleosome influences  the outcome of competitive assembly events in vivo. To test this  possibility and to determine why HSF, like most regulatory factors,  is usually bound to nucleosome-free DNA, we will systematically  examine the influence of helical orientation and other geometric  factors on the ability of regulatory factors to bind to nucleosomal  DNA or, alternatively, to prevent the formation of nucleosomes.  Cells will be transfected with plasmids that present cells with a  choice between the binding of a regulatory factor to DNA and the  assembly of the same DNA into a uniquely positioned nucleosome.  HSF and the ACEI factor will be used as model regulatory factors.  Results will be assessed using transcription and high resolution  genomic footprinting assays.  %%%  Because of its great length, DNA must be extensively compacted to  fit into the nuclei of cells. Compaction of DNA is accomplished by  histones, proteins which associate with DNA to form nucleosomes.  Nucleosomes are altered or absent from DNA in regions bound by a  second class of proteins, namely those which regulate gene  expression. Replication of DNA partially disrupts nucleosomes and  displaces regulatory proteins. Thus, DNA must be repackaged each  cell generation. Whether repackaging is by histones or by  regulatory proteins may be central to whether specific patterns of  gene expression are maintained or altered. However, mechanisms  which govern how DNA is packaged in vivo are poorly understood.  The goal of the proposed research is to elucidate these mechanisms.  We will determine how the unique configuration which DNA adopts in  some nucleosomes affects its packaging. The occurrence of this  unique configuration, termed nucleosome positioning, suggests that  if a DNA segment were forced by the binding of a rgulatory protein  to adopt an alternative configuration in the nucleosome, the  stability of the nucleosome would be impaired. To test whether  this can account for the formation of nucleosome-free regions, we  will construct a series of test DNA sequences. These sequences,  when introduced into yeast, will present cells with a choice  between ?a! the binding of a regulatory factor which excludes or  shifts the position of nucleosomes, ?b! the assembly of a  positioned nucleosome which excludes the regulatory factor, or ?c!  the formation of a factor:nucleosome complex. The choice cells  make will be related to the structure of nucleosomes, and  interactions between regulatory proteins and DNA.",a9206051,Initiation of Transcription in Chromatin,"August 15, 1992",$180000 (Estimated),MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"January 31, 1995 (Estimated)",David S.

The complex nature of geomorphic response to  climate change often results in differing landscape adjustments  to a given stimulus within a single drainage basin, resulting in  temporal lags in certain portions of the basin as the system  progressively adjusts to the new conditions. Because the  character and intensity of anthropic disturbances vary spatially  and temporally, geomorphic responses to these stimuli are  typically asynchronous and more variable. One approach to  assessing causality is to conduct tandem studies in several  different basins which have been subject to different types and  intensities of cultural activity while experiencing similar  shifts in climate. This project addresses the overall question  of late Quaternary landscape change in southern Italy by  examining the stratigraphy and sedimentology of alluvial and  colluvial deposits in six drainage basins. It will integrate  geomorphic, sedimentologic, and pedological evidence with  regional paleoenvironmental, archaeological, and historical data  in order to generalize about the nature and timing of landscape  change. Sediment data will be collected in the field, and they  will be augmented by laboratory analysis and aerial and  topographic map analysis to determine the causes of landscape  change.

At present these devices lack the  ability to produce or amplify light. As a  result design must be kept conservative to  reduce optical loss, thus placing severe  limitations on the allowable number of  integrated optic elements and their packing  density. Certain important functions, like  signal regeneration and fan-out (i.e., the  distribution of one data stream to many  outputs), must also be done electronically-  re-imposing both the bandwidth limitations  and the added complexity of electronics. A  solution to these limitations is an integrable  guided wave optical element gain. One of  the goals of the proposed research is to  fabricate a LiNbO3-based guided wave  optical amplifier, incorporating Er3+ as the  amplifying medium. (Er has a strong  emission line at ~ 1500 nm, a wavelength  of importance for telecommunications  systems and well beyond the optical region  where optical damage to LiNbO3 can take  place.) Toward this end, the PI has  recently developed a method for locally  incorporating much higher concentrations  of Er into LiNbO3 than previously reported.  This research has several promising  waveguide circuits which take advantage of  the unique characteristics of intersecting  waveguides. We have previously  developed a rigorous theory which  correctly explains both the coupling and  radiative loss characteristics of intersecting  optical waveguides and we are applying  this theory to the design and analysis of  Er:Ti:LiNbO3 guided wave optically  pumped amplifiers and light sources.  Preliminary measurements and calculations  indicate that reasonable gain coefficients (g  ~ 400m-1@ 1mW pump power) can be  obtained. We propose to continue our  study of the enhanced incorporation of Er  by way of co-diffusion of Ti and to  investigate several other promising co-  diffusants. In this study will also examine  the incorporation of pairs of rare earth  elements. Such paired systems may  provide additional useful pump transitions  (e.g., diode laser) as well as more efficient  energy transfer mechanisms for optical  gain. Site-selective fluorescence  spectroscopy will be used to characterize  the optical properties of rare earth ions in  the LiNbO3 matrix, as well as to identify the  substitution site and transport mechanisms  for this co-diffusion process.",a9204852,REU: ER:TI:LiNbO3 Guided Wave Integrated Optic Amplifier,"September 15, 1992",$335000 (Estimated),Deborah L.

Theory in this  area has not advanced significantly over the past forty years.  However, the recent availability of direct numerical  simulations opens the possibility of making considerable  progress. A main objective of this proposal is to exploit  this opportunity.   Results on the simultaneous three-dimensional time-dependent  velocity and temperature fields will be obtained for a wide  range of Prandtl numbers for turbulent flow in a channel and  for turbulent Couette flow. Present theories will be  evaluated. However, special emphasis will be placed on the  relation of the structure of the temperature field to the  structure of the velocity field and on how turbulent transport  is modified by molecular transport. Lagrangian methods will  be explored as a means to obtained better physical  understanding. The temperature field is viewed as resulting  from a distribution of wall sources. The exploitation of this  approach has been opened up because of the possibility of  studying, on the computer, the behavior of wall sources. The  transport of spherical particles differs from transport of  molecular species because of extraneous contributions to  transport by gravity, turbophoresis and lift.

We propose to make the data from the MAGIC array,  after reduction and verification, fully available to those who  request it ?MAGIC = Magnetometer Arrary on the Greenland Ice Cap!.  The MAGIC array compliments the magnetic stations on the coast of  Greenland for the investigation of small-scale, ionospheric current  systems. Operation of this array in the interior of Greenland  takes advantage of the established logistical support for the  Greenland Ice Sheet Program II (GISP II) at the Greenland summit.  Thus, it is possible to establish and maintain these stations for  a small cost. These magnetic stations form a two-dimensional array  with station separation of about 150km. The scientific objective  of these magnetic measurements is to investigate small-scale  propagating magnetic disturbances which appear to result from  moving filamentary field-aligned currents interacting with the  ionosphere. Different classes of these systems have now been  identified and the origin of the field-aligned currents appears to  be the magnetospheric boundary layer and magnetopause region.

For instance, there are visual  processes that operate on the spatiotemporal variations in light  intensity to generate brightness distinctions. Other processes  operate on variations in the spectral content of light over space  and time to construct color distinctions. Still other processes  draw distinctions based on spatiotemporal variations in textural  properties (e.g., texture contrast, granularity and/or  orientation). It is this last class of distinction-drawing  processes, or channels, that these experiments will investigate.   Histogram contrast analysis is a new branch of measurement theory  whose purpose is to (i) isolate individual perceptual channels, and  (ii) precisely characterize the computations those channels  perform. No one knows exactly how many distinct channels are  devoted to drawing texture-based perceptual distinctions, though  there is general agreement that multiple channels are involved.  Nor is there any data to indicate what specific computations are  performed by any one of the putative channels used in texture  perception. Heretofore, models of texture perception have relied  on arbitrary, ad hoc guesses as to the nature of the channels used  in drawing textural distinctions.   These experiments will use histogram contrast analysis (i) to  isolate individual channels used in drawing textural distinctions  and (ii) to determine their computational characteristics. These  experiments will thus make a start at the task of constructing a  table of the computational \"elements of texture perception\"  analogous to the periodic table of physical elements.

dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_04/a9204672.txt,0000099 Other Applications NEC  61 Life Science Biological,"The rationale for this work is based on the fact that all  photosynthetic organisms must adapt to changes in environment  light intensity in order to maximize photosynthetic efficiency.  At high light, excess energy has to be dissipated to prevent  photodamage, while at low light, photon capture has be maximized  to allow photosynthesis to proceed efficiently. We have been  studying the photosynthetic prokaryote, Prochlorothrix  hollandica, as a model system to examine the light/shade  adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus. This bacterium is  well-suited to these studies because it is structurally similar  to higher plant chloroplasts, but can be manipulated in the lab  more easily that higher plants or eukaryotic algae. Our work has  characterized the events occurring during light/shade adaptation  in both P. hollandica and plant chloroplasts, and we have shown  that similar mechanisms occur in both systems. Overall, we  believe that analyzing this process in P. hollandica will reveal  in more detail the pathway required for plants to handle  alterations in environmental light intensity.  %%%   Specifically, our work has shown that light/shade adaptation  involves in part the interplay of two separate events. First,  upon a shift to high light, the overall chlorophyll pigment  system becomes reorganized in approximately 30 minutes; we  calculate 40% of the accessory chlorophyll pigments are capable  of changing their orientation such that energy capture and  transfer is altered at high light. This mechanism appears to be  controlled by a light-activated protein kinase. Second, as cells  experience high light for several hours, a light-activated  metalloprotease activity degrades a subset of the accessory  chlorophyll-binding proteins. The function of this protease is  probably to limit the amount of photon capture at high  irradiances. Understanding precisely the mechanism(s) by which  cells sense high light and trigger these responses will help us  understand how photosynthesis is regulated in chloroplast (plant)  systems. To date, we have cloned many of the genes encoding the  components involved in these mechanisms; these include the genes  encoding the protein kinase. We are currently examining how  light affects the expression of these genes, and how the function  of the kinase affects the function and organization of the  photosynthetic light-harvesting antenna. Lastly, we are  examining in detail how the proteolytic activity acts to destroy  the accessory chlorophyll-proteins in high light; it is possible  that the accessory chlorophyll-proteins are targeted for  proteolysis by their phosphorylation by the thylakoid protein  kinase.",a9204672,Light/Shade Adaptation of Prochlorothrix Hollandica,"September 1, 1992",$153014 (Estimated),Eve Ida Barak  MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"August 31, 1995 (Estimated)",George S.

We intend to use these data in correlation with  magnetic field observations from the NASA AMPTE/CCE and MAGSAT  satellites in studies of the earth's magnetospheric and ionospheric  current systems, both large and small scale, as well as magnetic  wave phenomena.  We propose to contrast the global current systems during  active storm times vs. magnetically quiet times. A remote sensing,  two-dimensional, horizontal current analysis has been performed on  the MAGSAT data and matched to equatorial CCE results. These  results are preliminary and we propose to complete, improve and  apply this analysis technique to other cases involving dynamic  circuits. We propose to determine the full three-dimensional  ionospheric-magnetospheric current system during northward  interplanetary magnetic field conditions as well. The most  significant result and, also, remaining question is the confinement  of the northward Bz (NBZ) currents to above 80 degrees in the case  studied and the connection (or lack of connection) of the polar  currents to the auroral zone current system for other cases. We  intend to study the fine scale Birkeland currents involved in  auroral acceleration processes, especially in the context of the  storm and substorm circuit.  We propose to continue our analysis of shorter time scale  disturbances involved in the transition to wave phenomena. Some of  the wave field subjects to be studied include: global MHD resonant  and/or driven pulsations; local and remote particle-field cyclotron  interactions; multi-satellite MFE data analysis to study global  perturbations caused by solar wind pressure variations; statistical  analysis of ULF waves from ground and spacecraft data; ULF wave  propagation, including incoherent pulsation activity; and GOES and  CCE spacecraft conjunction studies of ULF events.  We intend to disseminate data and information by way of  scientific journal publication, presentations, and collaborative  efforts with individual scientists and agency program as we have  done in the past. We propose to incorporate the upcoming FREJA  mission data into this analysis effort as we have done with  previous magnetic field data sets.

The ultimate goal is to find systems that can cause four-  electron reduction of dioxygen and to use products of such  reactions to catalytically oxidize organic substrates. Initial  studies have suggested that five and six membered chelate rings  formed by complexation of the macrocyclic ligand donors to the  metal ions lead to high strain and prevent the formation of  complexes with the desired stereochemistry. In this phase of  the investigation new ligand designs that will result in the  formation of seven membered rings will be tested with the  expectation that steric effects will be reduced and the desired  product stereochemistry will be realized.

Work to date has demonstrated  that:  1) Sperm concentration in the field decreases rapidly with  distance from isolated males.   2) The fertilization rate of eggs is a function of sperm  concentration.   These preliminary data suggest that the dispersal distance of  fertilizing sperm when multiple males are contributing to  fertilization will be much shorter than the distances previously  reported for isolated males. If the probability of a given male  fertilizing an egg is proportional to the concentration of his  sperm relative to that of other males, then the dispersal  distance of fertilizing sperm will decrease as population density  increases. As a consequence, more males may participate in the  fertilization of each female at higher population densities,  leading to an increase in multiple paternity within a brood of  larvae. I propose to test these hypotheses by establishing  populations of ascidians with known genetic markers at different  densities and conducting paternity analyses to assay the  paternity of brooded larvae after fertilization has occurred.

The project focuses on two major goals. The first is  identification of changes in sedimentation style and pattern that  result from different types of volcanic eruptions. The second goal  is analysis of bias in the sedimentary record of volcanism.  Deposits of the Challis volcanic field represent a long period  of volcanic activity (51 to 40 million years ago) characterized by  an initial period of predominantly non-explosive intermediate  volcanism followed by caldera-forming volcanism. The sedimentary  system associated with this volcanism comprises high - and low -  sinuosity streams, lakes (claystone - tuff and turbidite  components), and debris - flow aprons deposited by lahars. The  study will identify the signal of different eruption types in a  diverse assemblage of depositional environments. The study will  also identify which environments are most sensitive to perturbation  by eruption and therefore, contain the best record of volcanic  activity.

The primary focus of this study is the  measurement of the diffusion coefficients and adsorption rate  constants in resins by an NMR technique. This technique was  first pioneered by the PIs using the protein hen egg white  lysozyme. This enzyme was labelled with a fluorine spin  label, dissolved in a medium without adsorbing boundaries, and  subject to an rf pulse. Equations are written for the  evolution of the transverse and longitudinal magnetization  imparted by the pulse. From these equations, the magnitudes  of the refocussable magnetization can be obtained as a  function of the tracer diffusion coefficient; comparisons with  the measured values of the magnetization allows for the  computation of the diffusion coefficient. The proposal  presents a novel idea for the measurement of adsorption. The  PIs argue that when the decay rate of the transverse  magnetization of the protein in the fluid is much smaller than  that for the protein on the surface, and the characteristic  time for adsorption is much longer than the time for  relaxation of the transverse magnetization of adsorbed  species, the equation which governs the refocussable  magnetization is identical to that for relaxation in a  nonadsorbing medium, with adsorption renormalizing a  coefficient. They suggest first using this technique to  obtain the diffusion coefficient, and then using a simulated  echo, in which longitudinal relaxation governs much of the  response, to measure the adsorption coefficient. Adsorption  is not lumped in the dynamic equations for the longitudinal  decay because the scale for longitudinal relaxation decay on  the surface is of the order of that in the bulk. The proposed  research will examine experimentally adsorption and diffusion  in new adsorbent materials, particularly size excluded resins  with small pores in order to determine the effects of hindered  diffusion, and then in ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction  and reversed phase systems. These materials will be studied  with a view towards end-use applications in perfusion  chromatography.   In a second part of the study, protein molecules will be  tagged with paramagnetic ions by means of chelators in order  to render the aqueous protons dependent on the local protein  concentration. The PIs intend to calibrate this effect, and  use it to measure concentration profiles in the interstitial  space. In a third and final part of the study, modeling  efforts will be directed at prediction of diffusion and  adsorption including the effects of pore size distribution,  adsorption kinetics, and high loading.

Maximum effects  are expected in the marginal ice zone where phytoplankton blooms  extend from May to September as the ice recedes northwards.  These productive waters can cover more than half the area of  arctic shelf seas, such as the Barents Sea, in any one growth  period. One of the main components of the phytoplankton at the  marginal ice zone is Phaeocystis pouchetii which, in its colonial  form, is a high producer of DMS. This species is known to  excrete a high proportion of newly fixed carbon as high molecular  weight polymers in order to form the colony. Later, it sinks in  mass in the latter stages of the bloom when nitrate becomes  limiting. Diatoms, such as Thalassiosira gravida, may dominate  the bloom at the ice edge late in the summer and may also precede  the P. pouchetii bloom in early spring (i.e. Chaetoceros  socialis). The different patterns of dissolved organic carbon  formation and cell sedimentation between P. pouchetii and diatoms  need to be included in productivity models for an understanding  of the production and sink of CO2 and DMS in arctic shelf areas.  The objectives of this field and laboratory study, in  collaboration with Norwegian scientists, are to: (1) to  determine the quantitative differences between P. pouchetii and  diatoms blooms in the ice edge with respect to primary  production, proportion of carbon fixed that is extracellular, DMS  production, and sedimentation of particulate carbon and sulfur to  depth: (2) to determine which are the main environmental  variables that favor each type of bloom using a 10-year time  series from the Barents Sea; and (3) to estimate a 10-year time  series of DMS production and CO2 uptake by combining the existing  time series with carbon and sulfur budgets of the ice edge  blooms.

Quasiregular mappings first appeared as a  modest branch of complex function theory (quasiconformal  mapping). The mappings are characterized geometrically by the  property that they carry infinitesimal spheres into infinitesimal  ellipsoids. In the second half of this century it was discovered  that these mappings proved to be fundamental objects in geometry,  such a Teichmuller theory, as well as to other areas of analysis.  The present work focuses on how the Donaldson - Sullivan  work on quasiconformal four-manifolds has led to new techniques  applicable to questions in nonlinear partial differential  equations. One of the first objectives of this work is to  understand what, if any, distinctions arise in the study of  quasiregular mappings defined on even and odd dimensional spaces.  Some of the deeper new discoveries are only known in the even  dimensional case. Arguments based on Hodge decompositions and  Cacciappoli type inequalities may yield additional information  about odd dimensions.  A second application of quasiregular mappings relates to  vector-valued analogues of singular integral transformations  consisting of matrices whose elements are Riesz transforms. It  is believed that the p-norms of these operators do not depend on  the dimension of the underlying space. Although it may be  impossible to achieve exact values for the norms, work will be  done in showing that the bounds are dimension-free. To achieve  this, a new technique called the complex method of rotation has  been introduced which applies to a broad class of integral  operators in estimating their mapping norms.  Finally work of a more geometric nature will continue on the  questions of the maximum dimension of removable sets for  quasiregular mapping and how Hausdorff dimension is distorted  under such maps.",a9208296,Mathematical Sciences: Regularity Problems in Nonlinear Potential Theory and Quasiregular Mappings,"September 1, 1992",$40000 (Estimated),John V.

Mathematically this requires solving a (linear) system of  equations, typically in an infinite dimensional space, where the  data only suffice to construct a noisy approximation of the  transformed signal. Solution depends upon the inversion of the  operator. Studying this inversion problem in a Hilbert space  setting can provide a unifying approach for constructing  solutions, by exploiting techniques from spectral and harmonic  analysis. Then statistical aspects such as error analysis and  cross-validation can be examined.  A famous example of this kind of problem is the technique of  computerized tomography used in medical practice to recover an  image of internal structures in the body. Because in practice,  measurements are blurred by errors, and because only a limited x-  ray exposure is possible, measurement of the \"signal\" (in this  case the attenuation of the x-rays passing through the body) is  imperfect indeed.

The results of the  proposed experiments will provide a broadly applicable definition  of the role of cholesterol in membrane structure and function. The  proposed experiments will determine the effects of growth  temperature on i) the plasma membrane content of cholesterol; ii)  the distribution of cholesterol between the plasma membrane and  intracellular stores; iii) the capacity for cholesterol  biosynthesis in liver and intestine; and iv) rates of cholesterol  transport from its site of synthesis into the plasma membrane. In  addition, the influence of modulation in cholesterol content on  various membrane functions (membrane fluidity, permeability, and  rates of transport) will be assessed. The rainbow trout is an ideal  animal model in which to address these basic questions in membrane  biology because: 1) trout remain active and behave normally over  a wide range of temperatures, indicating that they acclimate well  to variations in temperature; 2) in marked contrast to homeotherms  (e.g., humans or, more generally, mammals) the membrane lipid  composition can be readily manipulated in a noninvasive and  physiologically meaningful context, simply by altering the water  temperature, thus providing a powerful tool for probing the  relationships between membrane structure and function not available  in higher animals; and 3) the membranes of vertebrate, cold-  blooded animals are more similar to those of higher vertebrates  with respect to both lipid composition and diversity than are those  of microorganisms, which have also been extensively employed to  study this problem.",a9205234,Cholesterol and the Thermal Adaptation of Membranes in Poikilotherms,"September 1, 1992",$269021 (Estimated),IBN DIV OF INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY AND NEUROSCIE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"February 29, 1996 (Estimated)",Jeffrey R.

Multimedia information systems have emerged as an essential component of many application domains ranging from digital libraries to entertainment technology. However, most implementations of these systems cannot support a continuous display of multimedia objects and suffer from frequent disruptions termed hiccups .  This is due to the large size of these objects that requires them to be almost always disk resident, and the disparity between the low I/O bandwidth of the current disk technology and the high bandwidth requirement of multimedia  objects. To resolve this limitation, a multimedia object is declustered across multiple disk drives, enabling the system to utilize the aggregate bandwidth of multiple disks to support its continuous retrieval. Moreover, virtual data replication is being developed as a mechanism to support simultaneous display of several objects to different users. This project investigates techniques that: (1) provide on-line access to vast amount of multimedia data; (2) minimize the response time of the system by prefetching data; and (3) maximize the processing capability of the system by optimizing the placement of the objects across the processors.

One of the central problems in mathematical  analysis is that of recovering a function through various  differentiation techniques applied to integrals of the function  restricted to curves or surfaces. Although there is now a  considerable body of literature on this subject, the curves have  always been confined to those satisfying strong curvature  conditions. Efforts to obtain more general information will  require local maximal function estimates on compact sets. The  thrust of the research will be to find these estimates first.  This work, in turn, has close connections with singular integral  operators of Calderon-Zygmund type. One of the obstructions is  the dependence of past arguments on the Fourier transform. There  is now some evidence that progress is possible which will bypass  this impediment. Other work will concentrate on local smoothing  properties for wave equations. The general idea behind local  smoothing is one of establishing measurement of the size of a  solution of a wave equation for time periods rather than for a  fixed instant of time. The measurements are given in terms of  the boundary values associated with the equation. Some local  smoothing results have been obtained, especially in higher  dimensions. The most difficult cases are spatial dimensions two  and three. Ultimately, one must establish variants of the Kakeya-  maximal operator and control of its p-th power norm.  Work on estimates of degenerate Fourier integral operators,  radial Fourier multipliers on noncompact Riemannian manifolds and  estimates of the Szego kernel for pseudoconvex domains will  continue.

A fundamental form of  this process is classical conditioning. Rats will learn that one  stimulus, such as a tone or a light, is associated with the  occurrence of another stimulus, such as a food pellet or a mild  footshock; the tone or light will come to evoke behavior, such as  a mild fear, provided the subject has learned to associate that  stimulus with footshock and then remembers the stimulus-footshock  association. This project will investigate memory and behavior  when stimuli are associated with conflicting events or stimuli  (e.g., shock and food, or food and no food). Previous research  has shown that memory and behavior in this situation is strongly  determined by the current \"context,\" stimuli that are present in  the background, which can select between competing associations.  Behavior evoked by stimuli associated with multiple events can  also change as the memories age over time. The project will  investigate how time and context influence memory and  performance, and also how the effects of time and context might  interact. By studying the effects of time and context on  behavior over a range of related situations, the research will  provide insight into how ambiguous information is stored,  retrieved, and then expressed in behavior and emotional  performance.   The research will have its primary impact on theories of  learning, memory, and acquired motivation. It will also be  relevant to research on the neurobiology of learning and memory,  which has recently begun to identify biological processes in  cells of the brain that may correspond to the learning and memory  processes investigated here.

The  goal of Dr. Karsch's research is to understand the means by which  the changing seasons regulate seasonal reproduction, a natural  process of reversible fertility and infertility. He has selected  domestic female sheep as the model system. In this species, the  process of seasonal reproduction is generated spontaneously by a  self-sustained endogenous rhythm of neuroendocrine activity.  Changes in day length provide time cues which permit appropriate  phasing of this endogenous rhythm with cyclic changes in the  environment. Dr. Karsch will determine whether a short day  photoperiodic cue is effective when given during anestrus, and  whether a long day photoperiodic cue is ineffective when given  during the breeding season. The specific photoperiodic messages  will be restored by infusion of melatonin into pinelectomized  sheep. Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland only  at night, and it enables the animal to tell how long the night is  and thus the duration of the day. The outcome of this research  should lead to new insights into a fundamental problem of enormous  biological significance and practical importance: the regulation  of fertility. The results will also be more broadly applicable to  a wide variety of physiological, metabolic and behavioral rhythms  which form an integral part of the adaptive mechanisms in many  animals.

The latter models are also examined from the aspect of approximate and exact computation of real functions. The goal is to prove lower bounds for explicitly defined functions and to study the relations between different complexity measures for these models. This research could lead to new lower bound arguments and it could contribute to the understanding of the interaction between discrete and continuous aspects of computation. In computational learning theory, extensions of previous work on concept learning in on-line learning models are studied, as well as the  approximate learning of real functions belonging to classes defined by  smoothness or structural properties. In addition, concept learning in structures of first-order logic is examined.

The  planner typically cannot prove that any alternative will or will  not be successful, and so it much choose among plans on the basis  of how likely they are to achieve their aims and how efficiently  they do so. Decision theory supplies a normative model for  making these choices, but is not directly applicable to the  planning problem as AI has posed it, and more importantly does  not provide a computational framework within which to make the  choices. In particular, decision theory offers no advice on how  to generate or modify plans. Decision theory and symbolic AI  planning algorithms therefore offer complementary strengths: the  former provides a rich representation for expressing choice among  alternatives and a theory of how to make those choices  rationally; the latter provides a computational method for  generating and improving plans, but under restrictive  assumptions. The two approaches will be integrated to produce a  practical decision-theoretic planner.

Frequently studied discrete choices include mode choice,  residential choice, destination choice, industrial site choice,  land use policy choice, and retail choice. Psychophysics and  cognitive science research finds that perception is  probabalistic; even at the individual level there is a random  effect in how individuals perceive stimuli. This research  project will develop and evaluate a model that acknowledges the  probabalistic nature of the spatial preference and choice process  by portraying stimuli as having differential amounts of  variation. The proposed model has estimation properties that  allow it to be directly used as a decision-making aid in ways  that previous models cannot. By explicitly modeling uncertainty  and ambiguity, the model will allow for the unique estimation of  a single ideal stimulus or ideal decision alternative. The  proximity of existing decision alternatives to the ideal decision  alternative determines each alternative's utility. This is not  possible with existing models. The model will be tested using  consumers expressing individual preferences for residential  alternatives and analysts making consensual public policy  recommendations.  Probabalistic choice models were conceived because observed  behavior was too complex to be accounted for by simpler  deterministic models. This project continues this tradition by  seeking to develop a probabalistic choice model that will enhance  the ability to model a variety of complex behaviors. The  resulting model will be useful in describing individual as well  as consensual decision-making. In addition to its attractive  mathematical properties, the model opens up a variety of new  process models for conceptualizing individual decision-making.",a9207765,An Anisotropic Decision Aid Model of Spatial Preference and Choice,"September 1, 1992",$81252 (Estimated),"Brian Holly  BCS DIVISION OF BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE SCI SBE DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","February 28, 1995 (Estimated)",David B.

The two investigators  will continue research into 3-manifold supporting laminations and  pseudo-Anosov flows. They will also undertake new research into  the structure of 3-manifolds and more general spaces which are  not negatively curved. In a joint project, Mosher and Oertel  will explore a new technique for analyzing such spaces. Any such  space can be made to support a certain kind of 2-dimensional  measured lamination. The properties of this lamination will be  studied and used in an attempt to shed light on the general  structure of these spaces. In a separate project, Mosher will  continue a study of Thurston's homology norm for a 3-manifold,  and techniques for computing this norm using pseudo-Anosov flows.  He will also pursue a computer study of ends of hyperbolic 3-  manifolds. In still another separate project, Oertel will  continue research into a class of 3-manifolds called laminated  manifolds. The first goal is to extend methods and theorems from  the well-known class of Haken manifolds to the larger class of  laminated manifolds. The second goal is to show that, in some  sense, \"most\" 3-manifolds are laminated.  It is a surprising fact that, although we live in a three  dimensional space, a so-called 3-manifold, and so are blessed  with a natural intuition about such geometric objects, in the end  this does not carry us as far as we might have expected, for  questions which have been settled by algebraic calculations for  higher dimensional manifolds still remain baffling in the 3-  dimensional case. The most famous of these is the celebrated  conjecture of Poincare from around the turn of the century  concerning 3-dimensional spheres, where precisely the original 3-  dimensional case is the only one still open.

The importance of the subject stems from the fact that  a modal analysis of a nonlinear structure that relies on the modes  of the associated linearized system may require an unpractical  number of such terms in order to yield satisfactory modal  convergence. This is because, even through for the linearized  structure the linear models yield uncoupled modal dynamics and  hence optimal modal convergence, in the nonlinear case these  linear modes become coupled by the nonlinear terms, resulting in  deterioration of the modal convergence. The proposed nonlinear  modal analysis is based upon a definition and formulation  of nonlinear normal modes of motion in terms of invariant  manifolds. This approach is general and is not restricted to linear  systems, nor to conservative systems, nor to finite-dimensional  systems. In addition, the formulation is constructive for weakly  nonlinear systems and provides the physical nature of the nonlinear  modes, the associated modal dynamics, and the way in which the  nonlinear modal coordinates are related to the physical  coordinates.

The boundaries are generalizations of surfaces, known as (real)  manifolds. The idea of extending a function from the manifold to  a holomorphic function on the domain is actually a boundary value  problem in partial differential equations. Functions which can  be extended must satisfy certain (Cauchy-Riemann) conditions on  the manifold.  It has recently been shown that all CR functions on a  generic manifold extend over a wedge in a neighborhood of some  point of the manifold. Work will now be done adapting newly  developed techniques to establish the location of the wedge.  Another research direction will be that of determining geometric  conditions for extending CR functions over a neighborhood of the  manifold.  Analyticity or wedge-extendibility of a CR function on a CR  manifold propagates along complex curves in the manifold. A  natural consideration is also the propagation of CR  extendibility. Work will be done in showing that CR  extendibility is transported in parallel with respect to some  connection on M. A basic tool in all the work is that of using  analytic discs to localize the analysis.

Causes of high mortality of bay  anchovy Anchoa mitchilli eggs and larvae in Chesapeake Bay are  believed to be primarily from predation by abundant jellyfish,  which are both temporally and spatially patchy. \"Windows\" in which  anchovy cohorts can develop under low predation pressure are  hypothesized to provide a mechanism for successful recruitment. A  conceptual model predicts that anchovy larvae will be transported  up-bay and into the tidal tributaries by estuarine hydrodynamics.  This model and related hypotheses will be tested in this  investigation. Bay-wide cruises will map abundances of anchovy  eggs, larvae and predators, relating them to environmental  gradients that may affect survival, growth and distribution. Area-  specific age-frequency distributions, growth rates and mortality  rates will be estimated from daily increments in larval otoliths.  Areas of origin, and probable transport trajectories of late-stage  larvae and juveniles will be determined from otolith microchemistry  by analysis of strontium:calcium ratios, which should indicate  salinity zones where larvae hatched. Direct measures of predation  rates will be obtained in large drifting mesocosms under ambient  environmental conditions.  Chesapeake Bay is an appealing ecosystem within which to study  recruitment processes. Abundant cohorts of bay anchovy eggs and  larvae are presented with wide ranges of temporal and spatial  variability in predator abundances, food availability and well-  described estuarine circulation patterns.

However, major problems persist in resolving tribal  relationships and the monophyly of the subfamily Lactucoideae. An  expanded examination of chloroplast DNA variation in the Asteraceae  is proposed using comparative restriction site mapping of 10  enzymes and DNA sequencing of two genes (rpoC2 and ndhF) from  representative species in all currently recognized tribes in the  family. These new data will be combined with those from previous  chloroplast DNA studies to address both phylogenetic and molecular  evolutionary questions.

Upon starvation, the non-  sporeforming bacterium Escherichia coli differentiates into  markedly resistant cells by expressing some 50 genes in early  starvation. The KatF protein, which is believed to be a novel  sigma factor, is required for the synthesis of several of these  proteins, since defect in the katF gene substantially prevents  starvation protein induction and resistance development. This  finding suggests but does not prove the involvement of KatF-  regulated starvation proteins in the development of cellular  resistant state. Direct evidence will be sought for this role. A  katF deletion strain will be constructed. A drug resistance marker  will be inserted into the cloned katF gene which will be crossed  into the E. coli chromosome, using a recB recC sbcB strain,  followed by transfer of the mutated gene into the wild type  background. The katF structural gene under the control of a  titratable promoter will be introduced into the deletion strain.  Different amounts of KatF will be produced during starvation, and  correlation to the degree of resistance to starvation, oxidative,  heat and osmotic stresses will be determined. Two-dimensional  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns will be determined in  selected instances. This may shed light on which protein spots are  especially important in the development of starvation and other  resistances. Similiar experiments will be done during exponential  phase of growth to see if overproduction of KatF can confer  resistance during growth as well. There is evidence that KatF  synthesis may be regulated at the postranscriptional level. To  explore this, transcriptional and tranlational fusions of katF to  lacZ will be constructed using the polymerase chain reaction  technology.  %%%  Bacteria in nature exist primarily in a starving state. What  biochemical characters are expressed under starvation conditions  and how this expression is regulated are therefore important in the  understanding of bacterial activities in nature which include  besides disease causation, recycling of elements and environmental  detoxification. Starving bacteria are also important in microbial  based industrial fermentations because their use permits rapid and  cheap biotransformations using special bioreactors. Some fifty new  genes are expressed by Escherichia coli when this bacterium is  starved. A subset of these may be concerned with synthesis of  proteins that make the cells more resistant to many different kinds  of stresses. How might these proteins make cells more resistant to  stresses is an important biological question which can be  conveniently explored in this model system. In this proposal, the  aim is to clearly determine if a specific subset of starvation  proteins is involved in stress resistance. This subset is  controlled by a novel genetic element called KatF. By using  techniques of molecular biology, the amount of KatF in the cells  will be precisely regulated, the concentration of the proteins it  regulates will be qunatified, and a determination will be made of  whether their concentration correlates with the degree of  resistance acquired by the cells. Identification of proteins that  determine the cellular resistant state can make it possible to  manipulate cellular resistance; and an insight into their  biochemical role can provide information about fundamental cellular  functions.",a9207101,Genetics of Starvation-Induced Resistance in Escherichia coli,"September 1, 1992",$150000 (Estimated),Rona Hirschberg  MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"February 28, 1995 (Estimated)",A.C.

Polymers of multifunctional monomers afford a  number of advantages in that they form a highly crosslinked   polymer with high mechanical and thermal integrity as well as   low solvent (i.e. moisture) absorption. Many of these  materials are also transparent to light over a large  wavelength range. These polymer properties make these  materials desirable for applications as optical fiber coating,   laser video disc coatings, aspherical lenses, dental  materials, printing inks, and nonlinear optical materials.   This work addresses, from both a theoretical and an  experimental basis, the relationship between cure conditions   such as temperature, monomer functionality and type, and  initiation rate and type to the final properties of the  polymer after curing. Because the polymer behavior is  strongly dependent on the polymer structure and properties,   models will be developed to provide a framework, applicable to   curing processes involving chain polymerization. This  framework will predict the effect of reaction conditions such   as temperature, initiation rate and type, and monomer  characteristics and functionality on the reaction and on the   polymer structure and properties. Current models coupling the   volume relaxation and reaction kinetics will be modified to   predict temperature dependence, depolymerization, ionic  polymerizations, and termination by reaction diffusion. A  kinetic gelation simulation will be developed and used to  predict the polymer structure including the molecular weight   distribution, the gel point conversion, the cyclization  tendency, and the heterogeneity as a function of the reaction   conditions. Finally, experimental characterization of the  reaction progress and the polymer structure will be done using   free radical polymerizations of multi(meth)acrylates initiated   both thermally and by ultraviolet radiation.

For example, saturated polyesters (such  as poly(ethylene terephthalate) - PET and poly(butylene  terephthalate) - PBT), polyamides, polyarylates, and  polycarbonates are manufactured in either semi-batch or  continuous polycondensation reactors. Many of these processes  are characterized by multiple reaction stages and complex  reaction networks that give rise to various unwanted side  products. The pure molten monomers are polymerized in the  absence of added solvents - a more environmentally friendly  process than other industrial polymerization processes. The  process is also advantageous because the polymers can be  directly pelletized or spun into fibers.   A common feature of industrial melt polycondensation processes  is that multiple reaction stages are employed using several  reactors in series. For PET production, the sequential  reaction procedure includes: (a) monomers, low molecular  weight oligomers, and low molecular weight prepolymers are  synthesized in continuous stirred tank reactors, and (b) the  prepolymers are then polymerized to higher molecular weight  polymers in finishing polymerization reactors (often rotating  disc reactors) where large vapor-liquid surface areas are  provided. The final polymer product properties are mostly  regulated in this finishing polymerization stage, therefore  the optimal design and operation of this reactor is important  and is the objective this research.   Specifically, the PI will address the following questions:  (1) What are the major factors that affect the formation of  polymer films on a rotating disc? What are the  quantitative relations between the disc design/operating  variables and film thickness?  (2) What is the role of gas bubbles of condensation  byproducts in the mass transfer process? How can one  quantify the effect of gas bubbles on the total vapor-  liquid mass transfer rate?  (3) What interactions occur between the neighboring discs and  what will be the optimal layout of multiple discs on the  agitator shaft? What will be the optimal angle of disc  immersion in the liquid pool?  (4) What is the overall liquid (polymer melt) flow pattern in  the reactor?  (5) How does the continuous finishing reactor behave under  various reactor operating conditions and feed conditions  at steady state and transient state? What polymer  properties are most strongly influenced by what reactor  variables? How should one pair the polymer property  parameters with reactor operating conditions for the  design of product quality control systems?

Studies of gap  junctional communication in the early mouse embryo have shown  that cells in the embryo exhibit preferred pathways of exchange  that effectively subdivides the embryo into discrete domains or  communication compartments. The spatial organization of these  compartments correlate with ongoing differentiation and cell  lineage segregation events. These observations together with the  finding that the inhibition of gap junctional communication can  lead to developmental perturbations suggest that gap junctions  may play an important role in mouse embryogenesis. To evaluate  this possibility, in this study the embryonic stem cell approach  will be used to target the disruption of the endogenous gap  junction gene encoding Cx43, as Cx 43 transcripts are observed to  be differentially expressed within the context of these  communication compartment domains. Once such targeted ES cells  are obtained, they will be used to generate chimeras, from which  embryos and mice that are heterozygous and homozygous for the  Cx43 null allele will be obtained and analyzed. A detailed  histological analysis will be carried out to examine if  development is perturbed. The gap junctional communication  properties of these embryos will be monitored by ionic and dye  coupling studies. Of particular interest would be the finding of  perturbations in heart development, and the development of the  central nervous system, the segmented vertebral column, limb  morphogenesis, etc., as in situ hybridization studies have shown  that Cx43 is expressed in a striking spatially restricted pattern  in conjunction with development in these regions of the embryo.

Practitioners are faced with  many important but unanswered questions, including the number of  measurements that should be made on a part feature, and the  location of such measurements. Since the standard requires  knowledge of the entire feature while a CMM can take only a small  sample in a reasonable time period, there are no simple answers to  these questions. The objective of this research is to develop a  rigorous procedure for the verification of standard geometric  tolerance specifications, developing tradeoffs between accuracy and  cost. The research will involve the following tasks: a detailed  study of parts to allow identification of common profile variation  patterns for specific processes; the development and evaluation of  estimation techniques for the measurement of geometric variation;  and the study of the relationship between the number of  measurements and the resulting sampling risks.

This graph has  topological and geometric properties which are often related to  properties of the group G and independent of the set of generators.  Gromov's notion of \"negatively curved\" group, for example, can be  stated in terms of the Cayley graph as saying that there is a fixed  number c such that in each triangle of shortest paths in the Cayley  graph, each edge of the triangle is within the c-neighborhood of  the union of the other two edges. There are various other  properties which can be described in similar terms, although the  definitions are not quite so simple, usually. One of the most  interesting is a property invented by Stephen G. Brick which he  calls \"qsf\"; given a group-presentation, one constructs the 2-  complex which is described, having the given group as fundamental  group; one asks whether arbitrarily large neighborhoods of the  identity in the universal cover can be faithfully represented (in  a certain technical sense) by finite, 1-connected complexes mapping  into the universal cover; if so, the group is said to be \"quasi-  simply-filtrated\" or qsf. There are generalizations of some  results of Poenaru and Casson, so that one has a theorem to the  effect that if an aspherical, P2-irreducible, closed 3-manifold has  fundamental group which is qsf, then its universal cover is  homeomorphic to R3.  These and related notions have produced a revolution in the  theory of infinite groups within the last few years. The basic  pattern seems to be that one finds some facts in differential  geometry and topology of 3-manifolds; one abstracts to the  fundamental group level, and then one finds group-theoretic  theorems which sometimes have a reverse application to topology.  In addition, the subject tends to have a connection with the  computability of the Cayley graph itself; the Todd-Coxeter  algorithm for finite groups thus extends to various kinds of  computability questions about finite Cayley graphs. The theory of  \"automatic groups\" involves finite-state automata and regular  languages; this theory, however, does not apply to certain easily  understood groups such as nilpotent groups and matrix groups over  the integers; in order to understand these, one needs to extend the  notion of a finite-state machine in certain very restricted ways  which are not yet obvious.

Dr. Kimble proposes to take a combined genetic and molecular  approach to analyze maternal RNA controls in the nematode C.  elegans. The fem-3 and glp-1 genes express maternal RNAs that  regulate sex determination and inductive cell interactions in  early embryos. Preliminary evidence suggests that the 3'  untranslated regions of these RNAs regulate their activity at the  level of translation. Dr. Kimble proposes to address the  mechanisms by which the fem-3 and glp-1 maternal RNAs are  controlled in three ways. First, she will ask whether the fem-3  and glp-1 maternal RNAs are translationally controlled. To this  end, she will examine the distribution of their endogenous RNAs  and proteins and assess their association with polysomes. Second,  she will identify sequence elements necessary for regulation. To  this end, she will inject reporter RNAs carrying wild-type and  mutant sequences from fem-3 or glp-1 into the germ line and assay  their translational capacity in oocytes and early embryos. Third,  she will begin to analyze factors that regulate maternal RNAs. To  this end, she will rely on gel shift assays and analysis of mog-1  mutants.

Cohen, and by deep studies in the  structure of inner models of set theory and large cardinals. At  the same time, there has been striking progress in the theory of  compact Hausdorff spaces, and it is not always easy to see in  advance whether extra set-theoretic assumptions are required. The  investigator intends to continue his research on compact Hausdorff  spaces, including the application of special set-theoretic tools.  Other classes of spaces receiving attention will be the related  classes of countably compact and sequentially compact spaces, Moore  spaces, non-metrizable manifolds, Frechet-Urysohn topological  groups and topological vector spaces, countably metacompact spaces,  and weak and weak* compact subsets of Banach spaces. Finite group  actions on normal spaces will also receive some attention.  General topology is more of a foundational subject than the  rest of topology, concerning itself with very abstract spaces and  with the impact on topology of the adoption of variants of the  axioms of set theory. Although analogies to familiar objects of  geometry are valuable heuristics, the plastic, intuitive kind of  geometry involving low-dimensional manifolds is a far cry from the  study of subsets of a Banach space, the latter being more closely  related to classical analysis than to geometry, in spite of the  geometric terminology employed. One major result of general  topology in which Nyikos was involved a decade ago was the  discovery that a famous unproved conjecture concerning Moore spaces  was actually independent of the usual basic axioms of set theory.

The effort will focus on the purification  of mouse IgG1 and IgM, and a subfractionation of mouse IgG  into IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3. MAbs are produced by either  the collection of ascites fluid from mice which have been  injected with hybridoma cells in their peritoneal cavity, or  by the collection of the nutrient medium in which hybridoma  cells are cultured in vitro. Whatever the method, the  antibody must be separated from a complex mixture of proteins.  The proposal suggests using ion exchange dispacement  chromatography to effect the purification and  subfractionation. In this method, the feed is first passed  through a column, and the antibodies adsorb onto the column.

The general Cauchy-Riemann equations which test for  analyticity are expressed as first-order differential  expressions. In studying these expressions one tries to decide  whether functions defined on surfaces and boundaries of domains  can be extended as holomorphic functions to regions adjacent to  the surfaces. A fundamental tool in these studies is the  embedding of analytic discs into complex spaces of higher  dimension with their boundaries going into real hypersurfaces or  more general submanifolds. The vanishing or nonvanishing of the  differential of such disc mappings has far-reaching implications  in the study of mappings of hypersurfaces as well as to the  extension problem already mentioned. Ultimately the research  seeks to reveal more about mappings between manifolds, in  particular to determine new geometric and algebraic invariants  preserved under biholomorphic transformations. A second line of  investigation follows from the recent completion of a succession  of papers leading to the complete resolution of one of the  fundamental extendibility questions raised by Lewy in the  mid-50's: minimality of a generic manifold at a point is  necessary and sufficient to guarantee that every Cauchy-Riemann  function near the point extends holomorphically to a wedge. A  description of the wedge of extendibility is unknown even in  simple cases. Work will be done in finding a geometric  description of the wedge of extendibility.  Partial differential equations form the backbone of  mathematical modeling in the physical sciences. Phenomena which  involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials  and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are  expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships  between partial derivatives.

Thus, all the components necessary  for this patterning event are already present at fertilization,  and become asymmetrically localized or modified during dorsal-  ventral axis specification. This project proposes to identify  such components, determine the mechanisms of their localization,  and assess their roles in dorsal-ventral patterning in the frog  Xenopus laevis.

The logical systems to  be studied include fragments of arithmetic, especially bounded  arithmetic, and pure first-order logic and propositional logic.  The low-level complexity classes to be studied include alternating  log time and the polynomial time hierarchy. He is particularly  concerned with developing new and fruitful connections between  computational complexity and the proof theory of formal systems.  Past research has already established intimate connections between  these areas. This project concerns primarily (1) formal theories  with proof-theoretic strength closely related to various  computational complexity classes and (2) the structure of first-  order and propositional proofs, especially, the lengths of proofs.  Proof theory is concerned with such properties of proofs as  their length, correctness being understood and taken for granted.  Thus a typical result might assert that the proposition P is a  deeper result than the proposition Q in the sense that any proof of  P (in a specific formal system) is longer than some known proof of  Q (in the same system). A slightly more complicated type of result  considers a sequence of propositions P1, P2, P3, ..., Pn, ..., all  provable both in the formal system F and in the formal system G.

They have shown  that every open surface can occur as a leaf of some foliation and  ask what quasi-isometry types of surfaces can occur as leaves.  Markov-exceptional local minimal sets are well-behaved, and the  question arises whether every exceptional minimal set is in some  sense essentially a Markov one or, if not, at least has many of the  properties of a Markov one. In a remarkable series of papers,  Gabai has studied foliations of knot-complements, but much remains  to be done in this area. For example, the principal investigator  intends to construct foliations of knot-complements that are easier  to visualize and then to use the Thurston ball of a certain second  homology group to describe all taut foliations of certain knot-  complements.  A foliation of a manifold is a way of filling the manifold  with lower dimensional pieces. In the case of a codimension-one  foliation, these pieces are of dimension one less than that of the  given manifold. Think of an onion or an artichoke. The topology  of a manifold is strongly related to the kind of foliation which it  will support, and in skillful hands this relation has been forged  into a powerful tool for investigating the topology of manifolds.  It is an unintuitive fact that the major algebraic tools for  investigating the topology of manifolds work best in the case of  high dimensional manifolds.

In mathematics, symmetry plays a fundamental role  also, and it has many different but related manifestations. To  have a precise and logical understanding of symmetries of a  mathematical structure, such as a space, we need to discover and  quantify its so-called invariants and other important features.

The program seeks to understand how  physical processes influence the success of individual animals in  the sea--their feeding, growth, reproduction, and survivorship.  Models of global climate can then be used to relate global change  to changes in regional ocean physics and, subsequently, changes in  regional physics to modifications at the spatial scales that  influence individual organisms. Effects on zooplankton life stages  will be emphasized because so many marine animals undergo at least  one planktonic life stage and because the planktonic size classes  are most at the mercy of the physics of their fluid environment.

From a processing perspective, persuasion  can be modelled as an information processing sequence that  culminates in an attitude judgment. That judgment is determined  by subprocesses that encode, elaborate on, and integrate some  subset of the attitude-relevant information available. From the  processing approach, affective states have cognitive and  motivational consequences that influence the extent and valence  of encoding, elaboration; and integration, and thus of  persuasion. Past research in this domain is extended in three  directions: (a) the impact of affective states on reception and  integration processes as well as on elaboration is investigated,  (b) specific tests of the role of cognitive and motivational  variables as mediators of the relationship between affective  states, persuasion subprocesses, and persuasion are performed and  (c) the processing perspective is extended to the investigation  of the impact of negative (sad) affect. The first set of  proposed experiments assesses the impact of affect on the nature  and extent of reception, and its concomitant effect on attitude  change. Experiments in Set 2 examine the motivational and  cognitive mechanisms through which affect influences elaboration  and thus persuasion. The experiments in Set 3 begin to explore  the impact of affective states on integration processes in  attitudinal judgments.

The investigator will continue  his work with Sylvain Cappell and E. Y. Miller on the theory of  generalized Casson flows, on Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants,  on spectral flow invariants of 3-manifolds, and on the application  of symplectic geometry techniques in Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index  theory. Jointly with Dariusz Wilczynski, he intends to investigate  representing homology classes of 4-manifolds by surfaces of minimal  genus. A related topic is the joint work of I. Hambleton and the  investigator on the theory of smooth transformation groups on 4-  manifolds, equivariant moduli spaces of instantons, and the  equivariant Donaldson invariant. Together with Steven Weintraub,  he plans to continue their work on the cohomology of arithmetic  subgroups of Sp4 and also on an invariant of ramified covering  spaces originating from the work of J.-P. Serre. Finally, with  Alan Brownstein, the investigator plans to study the motion group  of n-strings in 3-space, its cohomology, and related moduli spaces.  Traditionally, differential topology has provided a means of  analyzing certain questions about the world we live in, its  geometry and its physics, but in recent years the situation has  become much more fluid, with physics often providing useful  geometric notions as much as vice versa. The latest such foreign  imports so to speak have been the Donaldson invariant of 4-  manifolds and related invariants discovered since but along the  same lines. There is, of course, a long history of mathematicians  involving themselves in the problems of physics, often to the  mutual enrichment of both subjects. Tools are developed to solve  physical problems, and these tools then turn out to have much  greater generality and become widely used in mathematics. The  story of the new quantum invariants of 3-manifolds is a variation  on this theme. Mathematicians interesting themselves in problems  of quantum field theory were led to a certain geometric  construction. The construction led in turn to an invariant that  depended only on the topological character and not the full  geometric character of the underlying manifold. There are now  modifications of the original construction and numerous resulting  quantum invariants. Their origin is sufficiently different from  that of other previously known invariants that they can be expected  to detect things the traditional invariants cannot. It now  behooves topologists to demonstrate this as well as to sort out the  different quantum invariants and their relationships to more  traditional invariants.

One of the most important processes in combustion is the formation and destruction of soot. The concentration of soot controls the energy radiated by the flame and the effectiveness of soot destruction controls the combustion efficiency and the environmental acceptability of the combustion device. FT-IR E/T spectroscopy is currently the only means of simultaneous measurement of gas species compositions and temperatures and soot particle size, number density and temperature in a combustion flow. The effort to develop and validate the method of FT-IR E/T tomographic spectroscopy for sooting flames was accomplished during Phase I. The major advance achieved during Phase I was the inclusion and demonstration of Hadamard data processing as applied to FT-IR tomography. The primary objective of the Hadamard technique is to increase signal throughput, increase S/N and increase the speed of measurement. This was demonstrated for FT-IR tomography, but the Hadamard technique also adds a significant simplification in the tomography apparatus. Experiments on a co-annular diffusion flame clearly showed that the technique can identify hidden three-dimensional structure. The Phase II program will greatly improve time resolution and develop techniques for practically probing combustors that have limited optical access. The FT-IR E/T instrument can detect species which are important precursors to soot and is expected to lead to advances in understanding the chemistry and physics of soot formation. The Phase II program will lead to the development of a low-cost (under $50,000), portable, versatile, in-situ combustion diagnostic instrument which can be applied to combustion process control, pollution monito ring, or research and development.

Although  Ar40/Ar39 dating places the crater age at 65.7+1 m.y., a 4-sample  paleomagnetic study reported the crater rocks to have only normal  polarity magnetization. Because the K/T boundary is found  worldwide in a reversed polarity interval, the normal polarity  results have led to the inference by some that the Manson impact  did not happen at the K/T boundary. However, the study was  exceedingly small, and moreover, the samples displayed some  ambiguous magnetization behavior. This study involves a two-fold  paleomagnetic study of the rocks in Manson Crater to determine the  polarity and age of magnetization. First is a detailed study of  the magnetization of the impact breccia. Both the matrix magneti-  zation and a \"conglomerate test\" of the clast magnetizations  potentially can reveal the polarity of the geomagnetic field at the  time of the Manson impact, hence whether or not the crater was  formed in the same polarity as the K/T boundary. Further the  magnetostratigraphy of the post-impact, as well as the pre-impact  sedimentary sequences will be studied to further narrow the age  range of the impact event. The magnetostratigraphy study also has  the potential to narrow the uncertainty of the radiometrically  determined age of Manson crater from 2 m.y. to less than 0.5 m.y.

Such systems often use  correspondence techniques to identify objects in an image; sets  of bindings are formed between groups of scene features (e.g.,  points, curves, surfaces, or volumes) and compatible groups of  model features. The discrimination ability ( or utility) of  individual features (e.g. points, curves, surfaces, or volumes)  and compatible groups of model features. The discrimination  ability (or utility) of individual feature groups in these  systems is a challenging and important problem in computer vision  research. When recognition systems are expected to select the  correct model(s) out of a database of hundreds or thousands,  indexing methods (which quickly reject a subset of the model  database from further consideration by the system) are useful or  often essential if objects are to be recognized efficiently, and  the use of feature groups offers a promising technique for  performing this indexing task.

The questions we  address in the grant is the muscular system designed to permit much  more energy for small animals to run than large ones?   It has been hypothesized that the underlying mechanisms lies in the  properties of the muscle fibers. The fibers of the small animals  are thought to have maximum velocity of shortening (Vmax) which  enables them to shorten faster and generate force and relax faster-  -a necessity for the high frequencies aty which they run. But  there is a price: fibers with high V(max's) use far more energy to  generate force, thus potentially explaining why it is more costly  for small animals to run.   With the new techniques that we have developed, we will test the  above hypothesis by measuring how V(max) and the energetic cost of  generating force of different fiber types scales with body size in  mammals ranging from mice to horses.",a9205397,Scaling of the Mechanics and Energetics of Mammalian Muscle Fibers with Body Size,"September 15, 1992",$190000 (Estimated),IBN DIV OF INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY AND NEUROSCIE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"February 29, 1996 (Estimated)",Lawrence C.

In particular, they construct suitable algorithms to  compute orbits of chaotic ordinary differential equations, such  as the Lorenz equations, and derive rigorous estimates of the  shadowing error in such numerically computed orbits; determine  general conditions under which an attractor of a differential  equation is well-approximated by an attractor of the discretized  system resulting from a one-step method; and devise a rigorous  numerical algorithm to test for hyperbolicity in specific  dynamical systems. They also study homoclinic phenomena, which  play an essential role in the analysis of chaotic behavior. More  specifically, they estimate the intervals of the parameter on a  dense subset of which a one-parameter family of dissipative  planar diffeomorphisms has homoclinic tangencies, and establish  the presence of transversal homoclinic points in slowly varying  systems.  Some of the more noteworthy discoveries in dynamical systems  have largely been based on numerical experiments. It is  important to devise such experiments whose reliability can be  rigorously verified. Most of this project is concerned with  chaotic systems. In recent years it has been realized that much  of nature behaves chaotically. For example, small changes on a  given day in weather parameters such as temperature and  barometric pressure can lead to large fluctuations in weather  patterns a few days later. A mathematical model that describes a  chaotic system in nature will almost inevitably behave  chaotically also.

Estimates of zooplankton production are critical in understanding  how short and long term variations in primary production affect  these rates of carbon transfer. Drs. Huntley and Lopez have  hypothesized that copepod growth is predictable with first-order  precision from habitat temperature alone. If this relationship  proves to be robust, we will have a powerful tool for estimating  zooplankton production. However, the apparent simplicity of this  relation raises major issues about plankton dynamics since it  denies the usual assumption that zooplankton are food-limited.  These investigators from the Universities of California and  Hawaii will investigate the thesis that, at the population level,  food limitation of copepods operates mainly through changes in  mortality rate. They suggest that there is strong evidence for  this in fish populations where density dependence operates on the  mortality of the early life stages. Thus, the general solution of  the Malthusian dilemma for marine populations is to die young  rather than starve later. They will address these key questions in  the following ways:  - (1) Direct measurements of the generation times of a variety  of warm-water copepod species, to fill a critical gap in the  database;  - (2) Experimental testing of the hypothesis that size-specific  predation pressure can compensate for the effects of food-limited  growth rate by increasing apparent development rate at the  population level.",a9201476,The Limits to Copepod Growth: Resolving the Malthusian Dilemma,"July 15, 1992",$200673 (Estimated),OCE DIVISION OF OCEAN SCIENCES  GEO DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES,"December 31, 1995 (Estimated)",Mark E.

They are singled out because they have the characteristics  believed to be fundamental for the study of quasiconformal  mappings. Work on this project will concentrate on showing how  the modulus of quasiextremal distance domains carries over to the  dilatation constant for quasiconformal mapping defined on them.  A second line of research will consider the length of level sets  of univalent mappings and the question of the largest power to  which such a mapping's derivative has a finite integral.

GII and nuclear pre-mRNA introns use similar  chemical mechanisms; consequently, analysis of GII reactions will  further understanding of nuclear pre-mRNA splicing. GIIs are  organized into discrete secondary structure domains; this suggest  that each domain has a definite three dimensional shape that forms  independenlty and is maintained in the presence of other domains.  Assembly of the tertiary structure of the whoe intron depends on  specific contacts between domains. Structural study of isolated  domains, mapping interdomain contacts, and assessment of the  interchangability domains from different GIIs is proposed.  This project will determine catalytically critical substrate  contacts between Domains 5 (D5) and other domains. D5 is required  for both steps of splicing. Mutant derivatives of D5 will be  prepared systematically to alter the structure and evaluate the  function of D5 quantitatively. These changes will target sites  that are highly conserved among D5s. Kinetic parameters and  structural requirements for splicing related reactions will be  determined. D5 (or derivatives) will be combined with Domain 6  (D6) to analyze their functional cooperation. D6 contains the  branch site that attacks the 5' splice site in the first step of  splicing. D5 and D6 will be tested with Exon 2 to study the second  step of splicing. To identify the site of D5 action, D5 will be  prepared with photoactive reagents and crosslinked to the intron.  Finally, chemical synthesis will yield enough D5 for direct  structural analysis. RNA catalysis is a widespread biological  phenomenon; this project offers insight into the chemical mechanism  of a unique RNA catalyst.  %%%  In the cell nucleus of plants and animals, genes are assembled from  mosiacs of expressed and intervening sequences by a process called  RNA splicing. All cells with nuclei first make long RNA molecules  by copying the DNA directly. The cells then cut and join the large  RNA molecules to assemble mature messenger RNAs that will be  translated in the cytoplasm to express proteins. The process of  RNA splicing must be efficient and accurate to allow functional  proteins to be produced. The cellular machinery for RNA splicing  is extraodinarily complex, to allow for fine control of gene  expression in development, brain function, and the immune system.  We know that many genetic abnormalities are associated with faulty  RNA splicing, so developing rational and effective treatments will  require a thorough description of the process of RNA splicing. The  RNA splicing machinery is built up with several small RNAs in  assemblies with proteins and dozens of additional protein  molecules. Because there are so many different parts, it is hard  biochemically to analyze RNA splicing from higher cells in detail.  This project will analyze a special kind of RNA splicing machinery  that operates in the mitochondrion, the energy producing  compartment of yeast cells. This special RNA splicing reaction uses  the same chemistry as splicing in plant and animal cells, but only  RNA molecules are needed in this case. We are studying how two  different RNA molecules recognize and bind to each other  specifically and then work together to carry out the reaction of  splicing. In particular , we will find out what parts of each  molecule are needed for splicing and where each molecule touches  the other one. We want to produce a very detailed picture of the  molecular structure of these two RNA molecules. This work will  provide a better understanding of RNA splicing as it occurs in  cells and a more precise picture of catalytic strategies that may  be used by RNA enzymes. Another benefit of this project will be  the possible rational design of antibiotics to prevent growth of  yeast and fungus pathogens that afflict humans, animals, and crops  plants, since animal cells do not use this special type of RNA  splicing that is found in virtually all fungi.",a9206525,Mechanisms of Mitochondrial RNA Self-Splicing,"August 15, 1992",$100000 (Estimated),Marcia Steinberg  MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"July 31, 1994 (Estimated)",Craig L.

In this first phase they will conduct  three projects. First, they will synthesize the available site  data for the period extending from the Aurignacian, ca. 35,000  years ago, through the Neolithic period when agriculture and  stock raising was introduced. Material will be collated from  museum collections and archaeological site reports. Secondly,  the team will develop a GIS data bank which includes information  on geomorphology and vegetation. It will also incorporate data  on archeological sites. Finally, the group will conduct an  archaeological survey of plowed fields in a subregion within this  broader area. The results should provide detailed information on  both the archaeological sequence and the density of sites.   Archaeological work to date indicates that this region in  Southern Germany contains a wealth of archaeological data with  sites which extend from the early Upper Paleolithic through the  Mesolithic and into Neolithic times. Therefore, this region  provides insight into how humans at a hunting and gathering level  of subsistence adapted to a harsh and highly variable Ice Age  environment. It also documents the change at the end of the Ice  Age to more temperate conditions as well as the succeeding shift  to a more settled Neolithic way of life. However, the data are  spotty and have never been analyzed within a single dichronic  environmental perspective. Therefore, it is difficult to  understand the processes which underlay the human adaptation and  change. In this the first stage of a long term project, Dr.  Jochim and his colleagues will establish the framework to make  such a comprehensive analysis possible.

Two classes of equations will be studied: those  possessing an absorbing set, where the long-time dynamics may be  extremely complex (chaotic) but remain in a bounded set; and with  those a gradient structure, so that solutions approach the set of  (typically multiple) steady states for large time. For fixed  time-stepping strategies, the proposed area of research is a  generalisation of the classical theories of A, B and G stability.  These classical theories apply to classes of problems with simple  dynamics and it is of interest to determine how the theories can  be used and modified to cope with more complicated dynamical  problems.

Despite that little is known of the cellular and  molecular events surrounding pollen germination, tube growth, and  deposition of the sperm into the embryo sac. We established that  flavonoids, normally found in pollen, are essential for successful  fertilization. Flavonoid-deficient pollen is unable to germinate  but this defect can be \"rescued\" by the exogenous application of  micromolar quantities of a specific class of flavonoids leading to  germination and tube growth in vitro and normal fertilization and  seed-set in vivo. How do these small, hydrophobic molecules induce  pollen germination? The basic tool to address this question if the  pollen rescue assay. To begin, the accumulation site and  intracellular transport mechanisms of flavonoids will be determined  by localization and kinetic analysis.

Multiple  (~150) radiocarbon ages from organic materials associated with  glacial deposits of the Miami and Scioto sublobes will delineate  a high-resolution chronology (e.g. glacial phases dated to within  30014C years) and architecture of these ice marginal changes  through the last glacial maximum. This record by itself will  clarify the behavior of southern sector of the huge Laurentide Ice  Sheet (a key component of the ice-age climate system). It may also  be an important repository of climatic change. If so, this basic  stratigraphic record will be the basis for tests between at least  two current hypotheses of ice-age climate. The first suggest that  orbital changes drive ice sheets which in turn drive climate, thus  predicting specific leads and lags between ice sheet growth and  climate change. The second view suggests that ice-age climate  changes result from abrupt ocean-atmospheric reorganizations, thus  predicting widespread, synchronous changes across the global  cryosphere-atmosphere-hydrosphere system. For example, the second  hypothesis requires that glacial fluctuations in various parts of  the Northern Hemisphere will be in phase and that these in turn,  will be concurrent with glacial fluctuations in the Southern  Hemisphere.

They can be fabricated into  films, fibers and molded products. Polyester can also be used for  packaging as well as in pure form, or when blended with wool,  cotton, etc., for clothing material. These products produced  chemically from petroleum provide many useful and indeed necessary  items for industrial and medical uses. However, because they are  synthetic organic chemicals from petroleum distallates, they are  not biodegradable in any known current process and waste disposal  of these products is an increasing problem world wide.  Polyesters of identical chemical makeup and properties can be made  by a large number of bacteria. Because they are made by enzymes in  cells as opposed to chemical synthesis, they produce stereoregular  polymers which are fully biodegradable. Essentially, these  bacteria use biosynthetic polyesters as food. Theoretically these  polyesters can be treated for disposal like any organic waste. We  will be undertaking a study of the enzymatic mechanisms of  degradation of these new biomaterials.

The Man-  Computer Interactive Data Access System (McIDAS), a versatile  computer-based system for organizing, manipulating, and integrating  antarctic environmental data will form the basis of AMRC. It will  capture the flow of meteorological information from polar orbiting  satellites, automatic weather stations, operational station  synoptic observations, and research project data. It will also  receive environmental data products, such as weather forecasts,  from outside Antarctica, and will act as a repository for existing  archived data bases.   Phase I, to begin in the 1992-93 summer season, consists of  the installation and operation of work stations that can manipulate  and display AVHRR data based on the existing satellite imagery  acquisition system. Phase II will consist of the acquisition and  integration of a system that will provide data collection, data  display and archiving, scientific applications, network communi-  cations, and remote user access.   The McIDAS system, developed at the University of Wisconsin in  the mid-1970's, ingests meteorological data from various sources:  standard synoptic observations, radiosonde profiles, satellite-  based visible and infra-red imagery, atmospheric profiles inverted  from multi-spectral scanning sensors, and non-standard data such as  TOMS ozone data, SAR sea ice information, and the AWS network  observations. The system automatically registers, calibrates, and  locates (by geographical coordinates) the ingested information and  allows a user at a work station to manipulate the data base. The  manipulations include sectorization, false color, enhancements,  brightness stretching, overlays, looping, differencing, and are  quite definitely keyed to synoptic meteorological research and  weather forecasting.

The  results of bleaching have potentially devastating environmental,  ecological and economic effects in the Caribbean, IndoPacific, an  other tropical marine areas. Though there is some experimental  work showing involvement of both higher than average temperature  and light, the mechanisms involved in bleaching are not well  understood this project will test three hypotheses.   1. Bleaching in nature is caused by high temperature stress  coupled with high energy blue light (and possibly UV-A between  380-400nm). Preliminary evidence shows that while high  temperature alone will induce bleaching, natural light  exposure during high temperature treatment exacerbates the  effect by lowering the temperature threshold and time to  bleaching at a given temperature. this study will determine  which component of light is responsible for this effect and  the mechanisms of action. Early theories on bleaching had  light playing a major role, but experimental evidence has not  yet supported this contention. Potentially harmful chemical  alterations associated with high energy wavelengths of blue  light (and possibly some near-blue wavelengths of UV-A, that  are not adsorbed by UV-protecting pigments found in corals)  are not only consistent with field observations of bleaching,  but are also supported by both laboratory and field-based  preliminary experiments.  2. The mechanisms of temperature-light induced bleaching involves  the irreversible dissociation of the chlorophyll-protein  associations in the chloroplast. The harmful effects of high  temperatures and light on algae include the irreversible  separation or inactivation of the chlorophyll-protein  complexes associated with reaction centers in the chloroplast.  Electron transport activity and eventually carbon fixation  decrease markedly.  3. High light and temperatures cause decreases in \"protective\"  pigments which absorb ultraviolet light. The role of  different wavelengths of light in conjunction with high  temperature in determining concentrations of UV-screening  pigments will be determined as well as their relationship with  photosynthetic rates.

The novel feature of the research is that the  sets under consideration do not form a group. This lack of  algebraic structure can often be compensated for by the existence  of an adequate algebraic structure in the measure algebra  supported on the set. The structures under consideration here  are referred to as hypergroups in which the algebraic operation  is convolution. If the elements of a basis of orthogonal  functions act as homomorphisms of the hypergroup, then one gets a  viable mathematical structure. For example, the initial one-  dimensional work in the area used eigenfunctions of a Sturm-  Liouville problem as a basis. The current project seeks to  extend existing structure theorems for compact one-dimensional  hypergroups to the non-compact case. Other work will focus on  characterizing the compactly supported hypergroups in higher  dimensions, developing a harmonic analysis of the disk  polynomials and the spheroidal wave functions and analyzing the  structure of specific families of non-hypergroup measure  algebras.  The hypergroup concept, abstract as it is, has its roots in  probability theory, orthogonal polynomials and the theory of  special functions. Particular applications include the explicit  representations for annular spheroidal wave functions even though  the functions cannot be given in closed form and the development  of hypergroup interpretations of characteristic functions in  probability theory.",a9208407,"Mathematical Sciences: Hypergroups, Measure Algebras and Polynomials in Rn","August 15, 1992",$40347 (Estimated),John V.

This project will examine the integration of two types of depth  information, i.e., viewer-centered information, which provides  relative distances between an observer and objects in the  environment, and object-centered information, which provides  relative distances within an external scene, independent of viewer  location. The viewer-centered information that will be studied  will include binocular disparity (differences in the object's  projection onto the retinas of the two eyes as a function of  relative distances from the observer) and motion parallax  (variations in the velocities projected onto the eye as a function  of distance from the observer). The object-centered information of  primary interest is structure-from-motion (use of changing  distances in the projection to recover distances between features  on a three-dimensional object, under an assumption of rigid  motion). One series of experiments will examine how the perceived  three-dimensional shapes of objects are determined by the  partitioning of motion in the retinal images into viewer-centered  and object-centered components (motion parallax and structure-from-  motion). A second series of experiments will examine integration  of shape recovered from object-centered information into a viewer-  centered representation of the three-dimensional environment. A  third series of experiments will examine the changes in the  perceived shapes and orientations of objects that occurs when  information indicating lack of depth is added to a three-  dimensional scene. A fourth series of experiments will determine  the minimum number of visible features on an object needed to  detect a surface from a combination of viewer-centered information  (binocular disparity) and object-centered information (structure-  from-motion). The objective of this research is to understand how  different types of depth information are combined to provide an  integrated perception of the three-dimensional environment.

Professors Charney  and Davis will continue research on a number of problems in these  areas. Charney (together with M. Shapiro) plans research on  several questions related to the automaticity of Artin groups. She  also plans to study the problem of putting a metric of nonpositive  curvature on several building-like complexes. Davis (also with M.  Shapiro) plans to work on the conjecture that all Coxeter groups  are automatic. Related to this is his project to study properties  of the boundary of a Coxeter group. This might also be useful in  finding a group of cohomological dimension two but geometric  dimension three (the Eilenberg-Ganea Question). Finally, jointly,  Charney and Davis intend to work on strict hyperbolization  procedures and relative hyperbolization procedures. \"Strict\"  refers to the possibility of converting a complex into a space of  strictly negative curvature (rather than just nonpositive  curvature). \"Relative\" refers to the problem of keeping the metric  on a subcomplex fixed. Charney and Davis also plan to continue  their research on nonpositively curved orbifolds. The issue here  is to decide when certain piecewise spherical metrics on spheres  are \"large.\"  Groups are the appropriate algebraic structures for describing  the notion of symmetry with precision. For this reason they play  an extensive role in geometry (and topology). While the more usual  interaction between group theory and geometry is the use of  algebraic computations involving groups to prove theorems about  geometric objects possessing symmetry, there is a very significant  mathematical subdiscipline in which the roles are reversed and our  intuition about geometric objects assists us in conjecturing and  proving theorems about associated groups. A fascinating recent  development is the influence of the computer in all this. Not only  is it the ubiquitous timesaver that everyone knows, enabling one to  undertake computations that would otherwise be too formidable, but  it has actually influenced the questions in geometric group theory  in a more fundamental way. Certain classes of groups have been  defined in terms of the types of hypothetical machines that would  be able to perform certain computations about them. Real hardware  is not involved in this, and the same definitions could have been  conceived long ago, but they were not, for the existence of  computing machines has influenced the way we look at the world, the  types of questions we ask about it, the kinds of properties that we  find interesting.",a9208071,Mathematical Sciences: Research in Geometric Group Theory,"July 1, 1992",$167400 (Estimated),Ralph M.

Myosin-I is the only motor molecule known to use a  lipid surface as a substrate for motility, and because cellular  movement is accompanied by motile events at the leading edge of the  cell where myosin-I is concentrated, myosin-I is a likely candidate  for driving cell movement. To search for proteins that regulate  myosin-I, extracts from Acanthamoeba castellanii will be screened  with three in vitro assays that measure different activities of  myosin-I: (1), a direct binding assay, to determine the effect of  regulatory proteins on myosin-I's association with membranes; (2),  ATPase activity to evaluate the effect of regulatory proteins on  myosin-I's enzyme activity; and (3), a motility assay to observe  the effect of regulatory proteins on myosin-I's ability to move  actin filaments. After regulatory proteins have been identified in  these assays, specific proteins will be purified using standard  biochemical procedures and polyclonalantibodies to each of these  proteins will be produced. These antibodies will be used in the  above assays to test their effect on regulatory protein activities  and in cells to localize the regulatory proteins by immunostaining.  These experiments will provide important information on how  myosin-I is organized at the cell membrane and how myosin-I's  activity is regulated.  %%%  Cellular motility is fundamental to the life processes of  unicellular organisms and essential to many physiological  activities of higher organisms, such as development, neuronal  growth, angiogenesis, defense mechanisms, wound healing, and  organismal locomotion. Cellular movement requires the coordination  of membrane and cytoskeletal systems. As a result of its lipid-  binding properties, the cytoskeletal motor protein myosin-I has  been implicated in many membrane-mediated motile processes.  However, unlike other motor proteins (e.g., myosin-II, kinesin, or  dynein) it has not been possible thus far to show that mysoin-I is  required for some generalized cellular process. The problem of  what myosin-I does may not be easily solved solely by studying  mysoin-I, since it appears likely that multiple genes encode a  family of myosin-I molecules with overlapping functions.

The research is aimed  at attacking a major limitation of current combustion  processing, namely lack of control over and uniformity of  microstructures produced. Enhanced vapor transport, which can  stem from either the ambient gas permeating the packed powder  preform or the presence of vapor production within the powder  compact during processing, has been shown to be a good way to  control microstructure during conventional sintering. The  general approach to be followed in this program will be  centered around development of understanding of the  microstructure development during reactive sintering/SHS  processing in the presence of such enhanced vapor transport.  Two model systems, a simple one-component TiB2 ceramic system,  and a more complex TiB2-Al2O3 ceramic composite system, will  be studied, with combustion synthesis of these materials being  carried out both in argon and in a reactive gas (e.g., HCl);  effects of gas composition, particle size, \"green\" density,  and degrees of dilution of the reactants on product morphology  will be examined.

Florida region. This research represents a  continuation of work previously supported by NSF, with emphasis on  new and/or follow-up studies of certain sites and on certain  promising new analytical techniques developed during the course of  the previous work (such as, artificial coalification experiments).  Three tropical and one subtropical coal-forming settings have  been selected for study :1) the Moin coastal, palm swamp of Costa  Rica; 2) the Changuinola swamp-marsh complex of Panama; 3) the  Arecibo sawgrass-mangrove swamp of Puerto Rico; and 4) the  Everglades-mangrove swamp-marsh complex of Florida. Although all  of these settings have similarities, each exhibits one or more  significant differences from the others and was selected because  it is expected to yield new and essential information with which  to interpret and predict the composition and geometry of the many  ancient coals that have been reported in the literature to have  formed in tropical shoreline-related settings. Since the focus of  the previous grant was on the deposits in Panama and Costa Rica,  this proposal puts more emphasis on the Arecibo and Everglades  deposits.  The methodology to be employed in this study will include: 1)  field measurements of pH, salinity and other surface conditions;  2) field descriptions of peat sequences: 3) collection of surface  litter and surface samples; 4) collection of oriented piston cores;  5) transmitted, reflected, and fluorescent light microscopy from  microtome thin sections; 6) low temperature ashing and x-ray  diffraction for assessment of mineralogic content; and 7) pollen  analysis of surface and subsurface samples combined with  radiocarbon dating, for interpreting the paleoecological and  developmental history of the deposits.",a9205670,Coal Petrologic Investigation of Tropical and Subtropical Peats,"July 1, 1992",$197614 (Estimated),Christopher G.

Risk communicators cannot afford to assume that  those who receive their communication do so with a tabula rasa.  Readers use their prior knowledge to organize and understand new  information. Both the contents and organization of readers' prior  knowledge affect how they interpret new information. Therefore  risk communication should be more effective if it (1) addresses  prior misconceptions, and (2) takes into account the readers'  goals, prior knowledge, and cognitive limitations in processing new  information. In the context of risk communication, these  propositions have not been adequately evaluated. This project  attempts to fill this gap.  The first study examines several designs for dispelling  misconceptions about global climate change and 60 Hertz electric  and magnetic fields. The second study examines the influence of  text structure and text comprehension aids on risk communication  effectiveness. The third study integrates the results of the first  two into two complete risk communications that differ structurally.  Multiple measures are proposed to evaluate risk communication  effectiveness in all studies, including performance on recall,  recognition, and problem-solving tasks.

Besides being able to operated at very high frequency and immune to radiation, it has been recently demonstrated as a product for flat panel display in France. One of the major drawbacks for vacuum devices is related to the fabrication technology. A number of issues have yet to be resolved before the devices can achieve its full potential. The emitters properties including their electrical, thermal, mechanical stability are often not optimized. To improve the performance of these devices, alternative materials and new fabrication technology have to be developed. In this project, field emitter arrays for vacuum devices will be fabricated. Two new materials will be tested as emitters, including WSi2 and InP. For Wsi2 emitters, it will be formed by either sintering W deposited on Si emitters or by patterning WSi2 that is deposited directly on the substrate. High resolution patterning techniques including electron beam and masked ion beam lithography will be used to define emitters with submicrometer dimensions in resist. Wet chemical etching and dry etching techniques will be for generating vertical profiles for the emitters.  The emitter tips will be sharpened by various dry etching conditions after the vertical emitters are formed, including faceting, undercutting, mask erosion, and dopant dependent dry etching. In order for the vacuum devices to be operational in air, a sealed triode structure will be fabricated using double angle evaporation. ***",a9209740,Fabrication of Field Emitter Arrays for Vacuum Devices,"August 1, 1993",$70000 (Estimated),Deborah L.

These strong and sometimes divergent  pressures can create trade-offs between the optimal phenotypes for  foraging versus reproduction. However, it is seldom possible to  study the concurrent effects of sexual and trophic selection on the  evolution of morphology. Recent laboratory and comparative studies  show that morphological variation in bluegill sunfish , Lepomis  macrochirus, is intimately related to both reproductive and  foraging success. The data suggest that females adapt  morphologically to the demands of the foraging niches of lakes  whereas the morphology of nesting males responds to changes in the  intensity of intrasexual selection.   The proposed research investigates the interaction between  selection on trophic morphology and sexual morphology in bluegill.  Morphological and behavioral comparisons among populations  collected from different lake types will correlate phenotypic  variation in feeding and reproductive abilities. Experimental  crosses and common garden rearing of young will attempt to identify  a genetic basis for phenotypic variation. A manipulation of nesting  male density in a natural lake will assess the degree of behavioral  and morphological flexibility of individual males, and quantify the  relationship between phenotype and nesting success under different  social conditions.

The  second is that direct genetic alteration of nodule PEPC and/or  NADH-GOGAT enzyme activities impacts upon nodule nitrogen  fixation and ammonia assimilation. The specific objectives  include: 1) isolation and sequence analysis of PEPC and NADH-  GOGAT genomic clones and initial characterization of the promoter  regions of these gene by deletion analysis and by protein-DNA  binding studies: 2) localization in planta of PEPC and NADH-  GOGAT proteins and mRNAs by immunogold staining and by in situ  hybridization; and 3) alteration in planta of PEPC and NADH-  GOGAT activities through direct modification of enzyme synthesis  by the expression of transformed genes.

Due to their high tensile strength, durability,  and superior fatigue behavior, composite  materials have been increasingly applied in civil  engineering constructions. One of such  applications involves the use of fiber-glass  reinforcement, sheets, or wires for seismic  repair or strengthening of existing structures.  Some success of such techniques has been  demonstrated in several case applications  around the world.   The use of glass-fiber reinforced techniques  have been successfully tested in strengthening  of reinforced concrete structural members such  as beams and bridge-column piers. However,  the feasibility of such similar applications to  unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings--one of  the nation's most vulnerable existing building  stocks to seismic hazard--has not been seriously  explored. This project ventures into such a  new research area where there is a potential to  develop a technically-sound and cost-effective  engineering measure to strengthen existing  URM buildings in the nation's seismic regions.   The objective of this exploratory research  project is to demonstrate the feasibility of  seismic strengthening of URM structures by  epoxy-bonding composite fibers to the exterior  surfaces of the structure. The focus of the  study are: (a) to determine the bond behavior  of composite fabrics to masonry, and (b) to  study the effectiveness of glass fibers as low-  cost reinforcement materials.",a9201110,Seismic Strengthening of Unreinforced Masonry Structures with Fiber Composite Fabrics,"January 15, 1992",$35000 (Estimated),Shih-Chi Liu  CMS DIV OF CIVIL AND MECHANICAL SYSTEMS  ENG DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING,"June 30, 1993 (Estimated)",Mohammad R.

The study of imprinting should help answer basic  questions about inheritance and gene regulation during development.  I propose to examine the feasibility of using embryonic stem (ES)  cells undergoing X chromosome inactivation as a model system for  imprinting. ES cells, derived from mouse embryos, can grow in  tissue culture, and by simple changes in growth conditions, the  cells can also be induced to undergo differentiation in vitro. ES  cells are known to form two layers as they differentiate into  embryoid bodies, an endoderm-like outer layer, and an ectoderm-like  inner layer. I propose to use ES lines which are heterozygous for  a number of X-linked genes, and an allele-specific assay for  specific RNAs to characterize X-inactivation in these cells. I  propose 1) to characterize X-inactivation in the inner ectoderm  layer and the endoderm layer, 2) to investigate large scale methods  of separating the two layers for biochemical analysis, and 3) to  analyze whether DNA methylation patterns found in mouse embryos are  preserved in ES cells.

Knowledge of the  deposition flux, cycling rate and burial rate of biogenic elements  in sediments is required to assess the influence of ocean processes  on global climate and to properly interpret the sedimentary record.  Recent results from this project have raised questions about the  dissolution of CaCO3 from sea floor sediments as a result of CO2  metabolically released in the pore water. Models of the alkalinity  change in benthic flux chambers predict an alkalinity flux from the  sediments, but the chamber data show little if any alkalinity flux  during sea floor deployments. The goals of the present research  are 1. To determine the influence of metabolically released CO2 on  the dissolution of CaCO3 in deep sea sediments; 2. To determine the  kinetic expression that accurately represents CaCO3 dissolution on  the dea floor. The first part of the project consists of a short  cruise to the continental slope off North Carolina to test a new  High Pressure Sediment Sampler and some alterations to the benthic  chambers by the P.I.

A lesson from the  Loma Prieta earthquake is that a  wider group of local government  agencies need to be involved not  only in mitigation, but also in  recovery and reconstruction.   This project investigates how  improved collaboration between local  emergency management agencies and  planning departments may produce  economies of expertise that result  in a more comprehensive effort in  all phases of hazards management.  Planning departments are a  significant source of poorly tapped  local resources to support that  objective. Theory suggests that  specific forms of communication and  cooperation between the agencies can  promote more effective effort under  different environmental and  organizational conditions.

Phytoliths are small bodies of silica  which are deposited within plants and are usually preserved in  soil after death and decomposition occurs. Although one species  of plant may produce phytoliths of many shapes, and very few  shapes are restricted to a single species, it is possible to  examine phytolith assemblages and make some species  identifications.   The research team will concentrate on corn and related species.  They will obtain phytoliths from different vegetative parts of  both domestic corn and possible confusing species to determine  what features are unique to corn phytoliths. they will also  develop an expert system to permit accurate and easy  identification.   Only under the most unusual conditions are plants remains  preserved in archaeological sites. Thus, because plants play  such an important dietary role, it is extremely difficult to  reconstruct prehistoric diets. In tropical areas of the work,  where preservation is extremely poor, this problem is  particularly acute. Phytoliths, because they are so durable,  provide a potential way around this problem and therefore merit  attention. However, because of the lack of one to one  correspondence between phytolith species, analysis poses  difficulties. This research should help to solve this problem.

In  particular, he will continue to study the existence and concordance  classification of positive scalar curvature metrics. He has  recently shown that if a closed manifold M admits a positive scalar  curvature metric, then the concordance classes of such metrics are  in bijective correspondence to a certain bordism group which  depends only on the fundamental group and the first two Stiefel-  Whitney classes of M. Also, M admits a positive scalar curvature  metric if and only if M represents zero in this bordism group. If  the universal cover of M is spin, this bordism group maps to the  real K-theory of the 'twisted' group C*-algebra of the fundamental  group of M, the twist being determined by the first two Stiefel-  Whitney classes of M. An optimistic hope is that this is in fact  an isomorphism. The investigator intends to continue his study of  the relations between positive Ricci curvature, elliptic genera and  elliptic homology; in particular, to pursue his conjecture that the  Witten genus of a positive Ricci curvature manifold M vanishes  provided M is spin and its first Pontrjagin class is zero. In a  different direction, he hopes to show that all the possible  multiplicities of a Dupin hypersurface with four distinct  eigenvalues are realized by the known examples, i.e. the  homogeneous examples and the Clifford examples.  Topology treats those properties of geometric objects which  are not dependent upon distances or angles, which are so  fundamental that they persist after stretching and bending an  object short of tearing it. In a topological sense, a phonograph  record and a wedding ring are the same, for no topological  properties distinguish one from the other. In fact, each is  topologically the same as a coffee cup. Their shapes are wildly  different, and yet there are some geometric properties that all  will have in common as a result of their common topology. The  famous Gauss-Bonnet theorem, well-known in electromagnetic theory  as well as differential geometry, requires that the total  (Gaussian) curvature of any of their surfaces will be zero. Now  curvature is a very non-topological property, and locally it can  have any value whatsoever on one of these surfaces, but the values  cannot be totally unrelated as one moves from point to point, for  the theorem says they will all sum to zero if one weights them by  elements of area.

The principal investigator seeks new insights into how  complex adaptive systems collaborate, compete, and coevolve. In  particular, the investigator expects to find new models of  economic take-off based on achieving a sufficient diversity of  goods and services in an economy. Similar concepts will apply to  ecosystem structure. Most broadly, it is hoped that investigation  of random grammars will yield insight into the self organized  behaviors of far from equilibrium systems.   Among the fundamental phenomena in biology and beyond, in  economic and cultural systems, is the coevolution of complex  adaptive systems. In the past few years, work carried out on  diverse fronts by a small number of physicists, biologists,  mathematicians, and economists, has begun to suggest a broad new  conceptual framework and candidate universal features of such  coevolution: Complex coevolving systems may evolve the the edge  of chaos. The new theory is built upon the recognition that such  coevolving systems, whether symbionts or interlocked firms,  mutually build the world they jointly inhabit. Such  coevolutionary systems can behave in three regimes. The first is  a chaotic regime, where each adaptive agent struggles to improve  on multipeaked \"fitness landscapes\" which deform so rapidly due  to moves of other agents that no agent comes to rest. This regime  is called the Arms Race in evolutionary biology. The ordered  regime occurs when all agents climb to local fitness peaks that  are mutually consistent. Adaptive chance ceases. The third regime  is the boundary between order and chaos. Two new facts have  emerged: 1) Mean fitness, or \"payoff\" is low in both the chaotic  regime and in the ordered regime and is optimal at the edge of  chaos. 2) A kind of \"invisible hand\" can act such that each agent  tunes the structure of its own landscape and couplings to other  landscapes to its own advantage, and by doing so the entire  system coevolves to the phase transition between order and chaos.  If generally true, the implications are broad. We must consider  that adaptive agents mutually alter the games we play with one  another, in evolution, in economies, and perhaps elsewhere, to a  characteristic poised state between order and disorder.  Signatures of this poised state include a power law distribution  of avalanches of change initiated by small perturbations. Just  such a distribution of sizes of extinction events in the  evolutionary Record are known. Similar avalanches may occur in  technological evolution.",a9201536,Coevolution in Complex Adaptive Systems,"January 15, 1992",$50000 (Estimated),Peter W.

Theory suggests that  female reproductive success is usually limited by resources  available for seed production. The male function in plants is  limited by the ability of the plant to disperse pollen. This leads  to the prediction that the attractiveness of flowers to pollinators  has relatively limited effect on the production of seed, but a  large effect on the dispersal of pollen, and hence the fitness of  the plant as a male. Despite this predicted importance of male  fitness to the evolution of floral attraction, the distribution of  paternal reproductive success in natural populations has been  exceedingly difficult to measure.

These new  controllers will have to deal with the following factors: (1)  more control problems involving highly interactive processes  with a large number of inputs and outputs will result from  increased plant integration; (2) more control problems will  involve constraints since the economic optimization forces the  plant to be operated close to the intersection of constraints;  and (3) control problems will embody more nonlinear/time-  varying aspects because of frequently changing operating  conditions and increased number of sensors and actuators.  Three serious issues arise for designing control systems for  large-scale, interactive processes subject to constraints:  ensuring robustness to model uncertainty, minimizing the  effects of constraints and monitoring and maintaining  performance of the control system in the face of a changing  plant environment with minimal human intervention.   The objective of this project is to develop an integrated  recursive-identification/control technique that is needed to  generate high-performance, multi-variable controllers with the  capability of adapting to changes in the environment. A  recursive identification algorithm that provides a family of  possible models and a predictive control algorithm minimizing  the \"worst-case\" error for all possible models are to be  developed. The recursive identification algorithm is to be  equipped with the intelligence to reset the model parameters  and uncertainty bounds appropriately from on-line data when a  sudden change in the plant dynamics occurs. Together they  comprise a multi-variable, self-tuning control algorithm that  can maintain high and robust performance despite little a  priori information on the plant dynamics and changing  operating conditions. A novel model uncertainty  quantification method based on the \"finite impulse response  (FIR)\" model structure is to be employed. The research effort  will span a wide array of system and control technology  including identification, robust control, predictive control,  robust control and artificial intelligence, and involve a  comprehensive blend of theory, experimentation and simulation.",a9209808,"Intelligent, Robust Self-Tuning Control of Interactive Systems","October 1, 1992",$89917 (Estimated),Maria Burka  CTS DIV OF CHEMICAL AND TRANSPORT SYSTEMS  ENG DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING,"March 31, 1996 (Estimated)",Jay H.

Polymer chains are incorporated into the  growing zeolite crystals to give a zeolite film of interlocked  crystals. Initial work was with water insoluble solid  silicones, which gave a process involving three phases  (polymer, solution and zeolite). No successful preparation of  self-supporting zeolite membranes has been reported previously  in the literature.   In Phase II it is proposed to simplify the synthetic process  by using a water soluble silicone. Commercially available  silicones will be evaluated as well as synthesizing silicones  to optimize parameters, such as average molecular weight,  water solubility, rate of conversion to zeolite, and physical  properties of the zeolite membranes. Elements such as boron,  aluminum and titanium will be added to the silicones so that  they will become part of the zeolite framework, giving the  zeolite uniquely valuable properties. The zeolite membranes  prepared will be evaluated for separation (N2/O2 and  ethanol/water) and catalytic (xylene isomerization and fuel  cells) applications.

These sources exhibit very low lasing  thresholds due to strong pump  confinement, they are tunable, and they  have exceptionally large gain bandwidths.  These properties make them attractive  sources for optical communications and  short pulse generation. Unlike the fiber  geometry, rare earth-doped waveguide  lasers in a planar configuration offer the  potential to integrate multiple components  on a single glass (or crystal) substrate.  The excellent transparency of glass, its  resistance to chemical attack, along with  its good mechanical properties and low  cost make it an ideal material for this  application. The primary thrust of the  proposed work is the development of new  active and passive rare earth-doped,  channel, waveguide devices on planar  substrates. Particular emphasis will be  placed on the monolithic integration of  multiple components including lasers,  directional coupler filters and distributed  feedback resonators. Device fabrication  will proceed predominantly in special melts  of neodymium and erbium doped,  geranium-rich, alkali glass using thermal  ion exchange techniques. Single mode  waveguide lasers operating at 1.06 um, 1.3  um and 1.5 um, will be demonstrated and  completely characterized. Single  longitudinal mode behavior is to be  achieved in the lasers using integrated  distributed feedback structures.  Fabrication of these structures will proceed  either by corrugating the waveguide  surface or by direct photoionization of  germanium-oxygen defect centers in the  glass.

The goal of her work  is to increase the accuracy of obsidian hydration dating and to  accomplish this she will analyze carefully excavated and well  controlled samples of obsidian tools from the site of Pot Creek  Pueblo which is located near the northern Rio Grande, New Mexico.  Obsidian (volcanic glass) because it is easy to flake and holds a  sharp edge was a widely prized material used to manufacture stone  tools. Because freshly flaked surfaces develop a measurable  hydration rind and because the depth of the rind is time  dependent, many scientists have attempted to use rind thickness  to determine age of tool manufacture. However, it is also known  that rind development is temperature dependent and that this  second independent variable must also be taken into account.  Since climate and therefore temperature fluctuate over time,  archaeometrists have not determined how temperature measurements  should be taken and how subsequent analysis should proceed.   Ms Ridings' work will help to resolve this issue. First, she  will conduct a systematic comparison of the three methods  currently used for measuring and estimating effective hydration  temperatures in archaeological sites. She will then compare the  results. Secondly, climate of Pot Creek Pueblo will be  determined over the last 850 years using both tree ring width and  isotopic composition. The Southwest in unique because of the  tree ring data which is available. Finally, she will model the  depositional history of the artifacts to integrate the change in  effective hydration temperature over time. She will then use  these data to analyze the obsidian artifacts themselves. Given  past work at the site, the age of these materials can be  independently determined.   This research is important for several reasons. It will help to  develop and refine an important archaeological dating technique  which is employed in many parts of the world. It will also  assist in the training of an extremely promising young scientist.",a9201588,Dissertation Research: Obsidian Hydration Dating: Testing the Underlying Assumptions of Temperature Measurements in Archaeological Sites,"January 15, 1992",$8694 (Estimated),"John E.

The study focuses specifically on  the mechanisms by which these films uptake solvent, and how  solvent permeation and swelling affects the adhesion of the  film to the substrate, and the membrane mechanics.   Solvent permeation will be studied using total internal  reflectance fluorescence (TIRF), a technique in which the  substrate onto which the film is adhered is placed on an  optical prism, and a laser beam impinges at a grazing angle  to the substrate /polymer film surface producing an  exponentially decaying evanescent wave which penetrates  through the film. By varying the angle of incidence, different  penetration depths can be achieved. Using TIRF, two types of  experiments will be undertaken. In the first, diffusion of a  free dye into an equilibrium swollen film or a partially  swollen film will be followed by placing a chromophore on the  dye. The radiation due to the evanescent wave causes the  chromophore to fluoresce, and by detection of the total  fluorescence of the film as a function of the penetration  depth (by changing the grazing angle), the dye concentration  can be computed by deconvolution (cf. eq. 3). By repeating the  TIRF angling as a function of time, the time dependent  concentration profile of the dye can be constructed. In the  second type of experiment, the polymer network of an  unswollen film will be tagged. The face of the film will then  be exposed to a permeating solvent, and as the film swells due  to the solvent uptake, the polymer chains will deform and the  concentration of the tag will vary. Again, by using time  resolved TIRF angling, the time dependent concentration  profile of the labels can be computed, and from these, insight  into the spatial distribution of the labels during swelling  can be obtained. The dynamical mechanical response of the  membrane will be measured, and a microhardness tester will be  used to determine the bond between the polymer film and the  substrate.",a9202413,"Solvent Permeation, Swelling Profiles and Mechanical Properties of Thin Polymer Films","February 1, 1993",$145000 (Estimated),CTS DIV OF CHEMICAL AND TRANSPORT SYSTEMS  ENG DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING,"July 31, 1997 (Estimated)",Maria M.

Especially during its early  years, the NBER devoted considerable resources to the collection  of data, culling this information from both government and private  sources. These data collection efforts proved extremely valuable  to future researchers in both academia and government. For  example, they led directly to the development of the index of  leading economic indicators. At the time the data were collected,  there was no method available for storing them electronically, so  the NBER researchers copied them by hand from the original sources  onto data sheets. In 1978, the Inter-University Consortium for  Political and Social Research (ICPSR) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with  funding from the NSF, transferred the data from the NBER's  handwritten sheets to magnetic tape. This tape is available to the  public from the ICPSR. A number of researchers have used the ICPSR  tape. The contribution of this project comes from converting the  ICPSR tape to floppy disks and verifying the accuracy of the data  using the NBER's original handwritten sheets.   Access to the data will be greatly improved by making it available  on floppy disks in a format compatible with common time series  packages for the PC. At present the use of data on the ICPSR tape  requires the cumbersome task of reading the tape on a mainframe and  then downloading the data to a PC. Since there are over 7,500  series on the tape, it is time consuming to download them all.  Additionally, the structure of the tape makes it difficult toe  extract a single series or a small group of series.

This is often essential for more realistic regional-scale  modelling of paleoclimates. The Great Basin of the western  United States comprises numerous closed basins separated by  towering mountain ranges. At present, most of the basins are dry  or contain only shallow ephemeral lakes. During the late  Pleistocene, deep lakes occupied many of these basins, and they  left abundant geomorphic and stratigraphic evidence. The  subsequent arid environment of the Great Basin left well-  preserved evidence unobscured by vegetation. This paleolake  evidence can provide excellent clues to the temporal and spatial  variability of coastal processes and landforms, lacustrine  chronologies, and hydro-isostatic deflection of the basins. This  project will study one such basin in Nevada. It will be the  first detailed analysis of lacustrine landforms and vectors of  sediment erosion, transportation, and deposition, and it will  reconstruct the lacustrine chronology for comparison with  chronologies from Lake Bonneville. Spatial aspects of the study  will rely upon topographic map, aerial photograph, and remotely  sensed imagery interpretation in addition to field study and  geographic information system analysis. The temporal framework  will be tested with radio carbon dating and amino acid analysis.  These methods should enable reconstruction of basin and shoreline  characteristics to fill out the chronological record.  This research will fill in an important chapter in the  paleoclimate record of the intermediate region between Lake  Bonneville and Lake Lahontan.

Many physiological factors influence the  development of the central nervous system. Among these factors,  thyroid hormones are known to be absolutely essential for proper  development. The actions of thyroid hormones are mediated through  nuclear receptors, which regulate the expression of specific target  genes in response to hormone binding. However, the genes that are  regulated by thyroid hormones in the developing brain are largely  unknown. The main objective of this proposal is to identify the  targets of thyroid hormone receptor action in the brain during a  time frame that is critical for proper development. Target genes  will be isolate using subtractive hybridization coupled with  polymerase chain reaction amplification to identify genes that are  expressed in euthyroid but not hypothyroid animals. These genes  will then be characterized with respect to their patterns of  expression and nucleotide sequence.

During development, many individual muscle precursor cells  fuse together to form each large muscle fiber. A basic problem  arises when one considers that muscle fibers are separated into  three, largely discrete, functional domains. Most of the length of  each fiber contains contractile machinery, but the ends of the  fibers are specialized for attachment to tendons while the very  small synaptic region in the middle is specialized for attachment  to tendons while the very small synaptic region in the middle is  specialized for response to neurotransmission. To what extent can  nuclei that have fused into one part of a muscle fiber contribute  to a specialized function that occurs in another part of the same  muscle fiber? The answer to this question is essential to an  understanding of the regulation and organization of muscle fibers.  The proposed research addresses the nuclear contribution to the  small but essential post-synaptic specialization where the muscle  receives instruction from the motor neuron. Cells of a muscle cell  line in tissue culture can be induced to fuse into multi-nucleated  myotubes which spontaneously contract and express elements of the  post-synaptic specialization even in the absence of neurons. When  muscle cells of different genetic origin are co-cultured, hybrid  myotubes form which contain nuclei from both sources. A  computerized microscope can then be used to track the different  nuclei and the molecules that they contribute to the post-synaptic  specialization. With this approach, it will be possible to decide  whether an identified nucleus is always associated with a  post-synaptic domain or whether it is free to migrate within the  myotube, thereby expanding its zone of influence. Careful mapping  of the post-synaptic molecules on the myotube surface will also  provide an understanding of how fixed and mobile components of the  post-synaptic specialization interact.",a9207052,Mapping Post-synaptic Domains in Hybrid Muscle Cells,"September 1, 1992",$187879 (Estimated),IBN DIV OF INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY AND NEUROSCIE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"February 28, 1997 (Estimated)",Herman Gordon flash@ns.arizona.edu (Principal Investigator current),IBN,"U of Arizona 601 Administration Building Tucson, AZ 85721 602/621-2211",Award,"9106,9181,BIOT,",Continuing grant,9207052,1192 NEURONAL AND GLIAL MECHANISMS,"June 21, 1994"

Along  with knot theory, the project is integrally involved with related  problems in combinatorics, generalized spin networks, quantum  groups, statistical mechanics, and invariants of 3-manifolds. In  particular, it addresses a tangle-theoretic recoupling theory for  the Temperley-Lieb algebra and its relationship with invariants of  graph embeddings, the SL(2) quantum group, and the Turaev-Viro  invariant of 3-manifolds. This recoupling theory gives a  completely tangle-theoretic version of quantum 6j coefficients at  roots of unity, and it permits the construction of the Turaev-Viro  invariant on a purely knot-theoretic basis. These topics will be  explored in the context of the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants  of 3-manifolds. Other problems about link polynomials will be  considered, such as the properties of statistical mechanical models  for the Alexander-Conway polynomial and relations with four-  dimensional topology.  Knots are rather elementary geometric objects whose really  interesting properties are topological. By this we mean that two  geometric knots do not differ in an interesting way if one of them  can be transformed to look just like the other without cutting or  untying it, just by pushing its string about to rearrange the  crossings. Topologists say that they are two different geometric  realizations of the same topological knot. Nevertheless, it is not  a trivial matter to recognize when one complicated geometric knot  is topologically different from another, rather than just a  different geometric realization. This problem can be addressed by  computing certain numbers or polynomials which are called  \"topological invariants,\" meaning that they always have the same  value for different geometric realizations of the same topological  knot. The problem would be reduced to pure algebra if there were  one invariant which also always had different values for geometric  realizations of different topological knots, but life is not so  simple -- no single invariant achieves this ideal, nor even all the  known invariants taken together. It is therefore valuable to  investigate new invariants, some of the most useful being those  inspired in recent years by ideas from quantum physics.

One indication of the  opportunity for sexual selection in plants is the occurrence of  multiply sired fruits. Such fruits are unambiguous evidence that  pollen from more than one mate was available to fertilize seeds,  and therefore indicate that female choice of male competition  (forms of sexual selection) may act. However, there is detailed  knowledge about the frequency of multiply sired fruits for only a  single, introduced species.

Preliminary studies indicate that  Lesquerella fruits are commonly multiply sired. To determine the  mechanisms causing multiply sired fruits two approaches will be  taken. First, paternity resulting from single and multiple  pollinator visits in nature will be compared. Second, observed  pollinator visitation rates will be used to construct a realistic  schedule of hand pollinations to investigate the effects of  single and multiple visits under more controlled conditions.

Past research has  demonstrated that newly deposited seaweed based detritus  contributes substantially to population growth of deposit feeders,  but that the particulate organic matter in the sediment also is of  great importance. Seasonal studies over the last two years  demonstrate that the sediment promotes declining population growth  from spring to fall and carbon retention also declines when a  deposit feeder ingests spring versus fall sediment. These findings  will be extended to experimental studies on the addition of  detritus in the field, since a diagnostic marker of lateral  transport of detritus is available. The experimental addition  studies will be combined with the marker approach as well as with  caged controls for predation, to examine the impact of detrital  addition and seasonal organic matter change in the sediment on the  population growth of the dominant oligochaete worm, Paranais  litoralis, and on the behavior of the mud snails, Ilyanassa  obsoleta and Hydrobia truncata.

The specific aims are to (1) build a frequency domain fluorometer that exploits the time structure of the Aladdin Synchrotron light source especially its picosecond resolution and broad excitation wavelength capabilities; (2) establish a preparative  biological sample laboratory in conjunction with the fluorescence facility; (3) train students in the principles of frequency domain methods using synchrotron radiation, and to operate the facility; and (4) conduct core research on the dynamics of biological systems. To accomplish these goals, we will draw upon our prior experiences (1) establishment of a synchrotron radiation facility at Frascati (Italy), (2) development of frequency domain  fluorescence instrumentation exploiting the harmonic content of pulsed sources, (3) design and construction of a microwave superheterodyning fluorometer and (4) establishment and operation of an international luminescence center (Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics), which provides biological scientists with a state-of-the-art fluorescence laboratory coupled with a functional biochemistry laboratory. Fluorescence time-resolved  experiments are invaluable in exploring the dynamics of biological systems such as protein and nucleic acid biopolymers, or cellular organelles.. The uniqueness of the Aladdin Synchrotron source in terms of time resolution,  brightness, continuous excitation wavelengths (ultraviolet and visible), phase stability, and pulse-to-pulse amplitude stability, makes it the best choice in the United State for a synchrotron radiation laboratory. After the initial  construction period, the Fluorescence Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory will become a research resource for the life sciences community.

This model introduces the problem of how many  processors to allocate to each task. The processor allocation  process must (1) determine the number of processors required to  process each task and (2) allocate and schedule these tasks on the  processors in the system. The objective is to minimize the time to  complete all the tasks.

The  first, joint with Avner Ash (Ohio State), deals with arithmetic  subgroups G of SL(3,Z). A cuspidal cohomology class for G which is  a Hecke eigenclass generates an automorphic representation which  should be attached to a family of Galois representations. They  will study these Galois representations in two special cases. The  second project involves a general approach to understanding the  cohomology of G(N) in SL(3,Z) for prime N. The third project is  joint with Robert MacPherson (M.I.T.). For any torsion-free  finite-index G in Sp(4,Z), they have built a G-equivariant  deformation retract (a \"spine\") inside the symmetric space for  Sp(4,R); it has properties like those of the well-rounded retract  for SL(n). They intend to attempt to extend their construction to  non-torsion-free G, and to build a similar object for Sp(6) and  higher-rank groups.  The intricate computations envisioned here are intended to  shed light on structures which arise in important ways in several  different mathematical areas. The so-called arithmetic locally  symmetric spaces interest number theorists as well as geometers,  while some of the questions about them have been transformed by the  investigator into pure topology. No transformation removes their  difficulty, but when looked at in the right way, some difficulties  can be seen to have been addressed by earlier generations of  geometers. Seventeenth and nineteenth century geometers studied a  beautiful class of objects known as projective configurations, and  bearing out the mathematical dictum that beautiful objects repay  study because they recur again and again in different guises,  properties of these configurations have turned out to bear on the  cohomology of certain arithmetic groups, normally considered a  purely twentieth century invention.",a9206659,Mathematical Sciences: Topics in the Cohomology of Arithmetic Groups,"August 15, 1992",$49100 (Estimated),Ralph M.

Major questions  that remain concern what factors are needed for their assembly and  how these individual factors are themselves transported to the  proper compartments.  The long-term objective of this work is to understand at a detailed  molecular level the specific proteins and events that are required  for the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes. Moreover, the mechanism  by which heme is transported across bilayer membranes from its site  of biosynthesis, the mitochondrial matrix or the bacterial  cytoplasm, is a fundamental question in biology.  Specifically, using the Gram negative photosynthetic bacterium,  Rhodobacter capsulatus, we will develop biochemical assays for  processes required in cytochrome c biogenesis. Previous molecular  analysis of R.capsulatus mutants that are defective in cytochrome  c biogenesis have indicated that hel genes may encode the first-  reported specific heme transporter; ccl gene products may be  involved in the ligation of heme to apocytochrome c in the  periplasmic space. Thus, we will develop (1) in vitro heme  transport assays and (2) in vitro heme lyase assays and apply these  to R. capsulatus mutants that are predicted to be defective in  these processes.  %%%  Both eucaryotes and procaryotes possess heme proteins called c-type  cytochromes that are present in distinct compartments within their  cells. These cytochromes are vital for mitochondrial and bacterial  electron transport processes and consequently ATP production. The  c-type cytochromes have been the subject of thousands of studies  concerning their function and structure (e.g., X-ray  crystallography). Nevertheless, little is known about how a native  c-type cytochrome is assembled in a particular compartment. For  example, it is unknown how (and in what form) heme is transported  from its site of biosynthesis, the mitochondrial matrix or the  bacterial cytoplasm, to the assembly site of the cytochrome (i.e.,  the mitochondrial intermembrane space or the bacterial periplasm).  Thus, the mechanism of heme transport across bilayer membranes is  a fundamental question in biology.  Our previous molecular genetic analysis of mutants in the  bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus that are specially defective in  cytochromes c biogenesis, have implicated specific gene products  (called hel) as the best candidate (and first ever reported) for a  specific heme transporter. This proposal includes the development  of in vitro heme transport assays to further investigate these  defects. Additionally, the mechanism by which heme is covalently  ligated to the apocytochromes will be studied by the development of  in vitro assays for this process.

This turned  out to be the case and is now known as the Finite Riemann Mapping  Theorem. The proof spawned a new line of investigation within  the field of complex analysis: what type of theorems can be  proved by circle packing and, more importantly, what  new discoveries are opened up by means of this new technique?  Work now continues as the breadth of possibilities broadens.  Topics to be investigated include hexagonal packing and the  asymptotics and the ratios of maximum and minimum radii, the  classical problem of canonical conformal maps of multiply  connected regions - whether arbitrary domains are conformally  equivalent to domains with boundary components of circles or  line. Work will also be done in extending results on osculating  Mobius transformations of a circle packing which are known to  converge and give the first and second derivatives of the Riemann  map.

In order to carry out this research, he has  selected case studies that represent experimental approaches to  determining the mechanisms responsible (i) for creating the  asymmetric distribution of Na+ and K+ between cells and their  environments and (ii) for linking the oxidation of nutrients to the  production of ATP by the cell mitochondria. These inquires  converged in formulations of active transport across biological  membranes, and led to the recognition of ATP-utilizing enzymes that  create ion gradients, ATP-synthesizing enzymes that consume ion  gradients, and the role of both ATP and ion gradients as potential  energy reservoirs for driving cellular function. The case studies  also represent the variety of experimental origins and outcomes:  theory-driven and serendipitous discovery, falsification and  immunity to falsification, corroboration, controversy, consensus  formation, and the attainment of conceptual unity through the  reductionist program. The goals of this project include drawing to  the attention of historians and philosophers of science such  ordinary practice, and illustrating to working scientists some  practical and theoretical aspects of their toils--including causes  and consequences of success and failure in rival research programs.",a9209158,Membrane Transport: Biology/History/Philosophy,"January 1, 1993",$45000 (Estimated),"Edward J.

Objectives of the research  are:  1. The acoustical conditions in many significant rooms in North  America will be characterized in detail by the new measures of  acoustical quality.  2. Comparisons of the simultaneous measurements made by three  research teams will test the acceptability of the draft of ISO 3382  standard for the new impulse response type of acoustical  measurements regarding many specifics of the data acquisition and  analysis process.  3. The comparisons of the different measurement techniques would  also allow the extensive data base of detailed acoustical  measurements for the statistical modeling of room acoustics with  the architectural properties of the rooms on an unprecedented  scale. These models based on an extremely large sample would  provide a deeper understanding of the build-up and decay of sounds  in complex rooms and the fundamental relationships among acoustical  measurements and architectural properties of rooms.  4. High quality impulse responses from multiple source and receiver  locations would be gathered in each room studied.   The results of this research will have a major and immediate impact  on the state of architectural acoustics. the scientific basis for  acoustical decision-making in the design of buildings will be  greatly expanded.

dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_09/a9209665.txt,0319000 Climate Related Activities  41 Atmospheric Sciences,"The \"thermostat hypothesis\" depends upon three postulates.  First, a super-greenhouse effect exists. Satellite data reveal  that the atmosphere over the warmest oceans is very humid, causing  it to trap a significant fraction of the infrared energy emitted by  the ocean. Furthermore, the infrared trapping - known as the  greenhouse effect - increases very sharply with increasing SST in  regions of convection. This creates an instability which requires  some sort of negative feedback (e.g. thermostat) in order to keep  the ocean and atmosphere in their present, stable state. Second,  there is a threshold temperature above which deep convection  begins. Third, bright cirrus anvils, which reach altitudes of 16  km (55,000 ft.) and extend over tens of thousands of square  kilometers, reflect significant amounts of solar energy back to  space so that the sea surface cools down, hence, the thermostat.   The goal of CEPEX is to test the thermostat hypothesis and  thus understand the role of the water vapor greenhouse effect,  cloud-radiative interactions and evaporation in regulating SSTs.   Three aircraft will be deployed in CEPEX: A high altitude  aircraft - flying above the anvil clouds at altitudes of 55,000 -  60,000 feet - to collect data on solar energy reflected by clouds,  infrared energy radiated by the surface-atmosphere system, and the  top and bottom altitudes of the cirrus anvils; an intermediate  aircraft - flying below the anvils at 35,000 - 40,000 feet - to  measure the super-greenhouse effect, the energy regulation by anvil  clouds, and the vertical distributions of water vapor and  temperature; and a low altitude aircraft to measure the evaporation  and heat release from the ocean to the atmosphere from an altitude  of about 150 feet.   Since the central objective is to measure the impact of SST  differences, flight plans will span the central equatorial Pacific,  about 700 nautical miles to either side of the date line. This  region encompasses the desired SST range, with frequent convection  west and south of the date line, but little to the east. The  flights measuring radiant energy will originate from Fiji island  (17oS, 178oE). The region between Fiji and the equator also  contains large SST gradients in the desired range between 27oC and  30oC. Evaporation measurements will be made along the equator  between Nauru Island and Christmas Island.   The high altitude measurements will be made over a one month  period beginning approximately March 1, 1993. The high and  intermediate aircraft will fly about every other day for a total of  100 flight hours each. Surface evaporation measurements will be  taken by the low-level aircraft during the first half of the  experiment.   The question of how tropical SSTs are regulated is important  to understanding the regulation of the Earth's climate in general;  in particular, the atmospheric behavior in the warm pool region may  become more widespread in the event of anticipated global warming.",a9209665,Central Equatorial Pacific Experiment (CEPEX); An Airborne Experiment to Address Issues Concerning the Role of Cloud-Radiation Feedbacks in El-Nino and Global Warming,"October 1, 1992",$123225 (Estimated),Jay S.

The first area is an interdisciplinary study  done in collaboration with Dr. J. W. Zyskind on the modeling of  initiation of DNA replication in Escherichia coli. Using  mathematical models, they attempt to explain which are the most  important steps in the beginning of the DNA replication cycle.  Several other regulatory processes for growing cells are  examined, providing additional insight into cellular control  systems and introducing new dynamical systems to study. The  second area of inquiry analyzes the stability region for a linear  differential equation with two delays. Both analytical and  numerical techniques are used to determine how the stability  region varies with the parameters in this equation. The  stability region varies dramatically for even small changes in  some parameters, so studying these anomalies is very important  from a modeling point of view. The final area of investigation  examines mathematical models for erythropoiesis and  thrombopoiesis. Previous models have included two delays linking  this study to the previous one. More recently, models have been  developed using either state-dependent delays or age-structured  modeling. The principal investigator has developed a new  age-structured model that more accurately reflects the biology in  hematopoietic systems. He will undertake mathematical studies to  determine the qualitative behavior of this model and to examine  how it compares to models with either multiple delays or  state-dependent delays. Parameter identification methods may  provide quantitative information for how these systems can become  unstable in certain disease states.  The principal objective of this project is to develop  mathematical models that correspond to known biological behavior.  The models will provide insight into the mechanisms that govern  the specific biological problem. DNA replication marks the  beginning of the cell cycle in bacteria. An understanding of the  controls underlying the cell cycle is important for other areas  of research, including genetic engineering and cancer research.  The mathematical studies provide support for certain biological  experiments, suggest further avenues of experimentation, and show  how some biological theories are impossible. The computer  simulations of cellular processes require less time to perform  than experiments and are significantly less costly. However, it  is the interaction between the experimenter and the mathematical  modeler in this study that will be most important to the  advancement in understanding the cell cycle. Mathematical models  for erythropoiesis or red blood cell production can elucidate the  effects of certain changes in this complicated process that  begins with simple undifferentiated cells in the bone marrow and  proceeds to mature red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout  the body. The models may explain the mechanisms underlying  certain blood diseases and suggest possible therapeutic  procedures. The models could aid in developing new procedures to  efficiently collect blood, which is significant for patients who  choose to provide their own blood supply for elective surgery and  avoid risks of HIV infection.

Three variables are important:  productivity flowing from the marine to terrestrial ecosystems;  the presence of predators; and relative colonizing ability.  Small island receive more nutrients from shore drift and marine  birds (land plants provide little energy). The scaling effect is   counter-intuitive to the general notion that larger islands are  more productive. Scaling also influences predation: small  islands lack many predators found on larger islands, allowing  high marine productivity to produce large populations. Predators   drastically reduce population size on larger islands and the  mainland. Thus community and food web dynamics vary greatly with   habitat size, productivity, species composition and dependence on   habitats.

Barriers to immigration may result in shifts in dominance and affect community structure and function.  Percolation theory provides a mechanism for developing hypotheses regarding movement of organisms through the environment. Community structure in grasslands resembles a percolation network, however, the applicability of percolation network, however, the applicability of percolation theory to plant community structure has not been evaluated. A series of hypotheses will be tested using field experiments and simulation modeling to determine the applicability of percolation theory to predicting spatial patterns of dominance and diversity in grassland vegetation. Previous studies have shown grasslands to be highly dynamic at small spatial scales over short periods. Preliminary results from stimulation models of clonal growth in percolation networks suggests that species diversity is affected by barriers to movement. Above a critical threshold, species diversity declined in these models as superior competitors dominated available space. A series of experimental percolation networks in grassland vegetation will be created and clonal growth of prennial species, local patterns of immigration and extinction, species diversity, and spatial pattern will be monitored. Field experiments will be supplemented by modelling percolation of clonal plants with different rates of spread and competitive abilities. This study will help to determine the utility of percolation theory to small-scale plant comm unity dynamics in grassland vegetation.                   ! !  !

The  lack of sufficient water can place strains on plants, which may  result in decreased yields or increased susceptibility to disease.  Yet plants not only survive but proliferate on land, even in water-  limited environments such as semi-arid areas and deserts. This  remarkable ability to tolerate seemingly inhospitable conditions  is due to the cumulative effects of nmerous adaptive properties  that exist within plants. In seed-bearing plants the best example  of such adaptability is the seed itself, which often remains alive  in a relatively dry state for many years. Studies over the last  decade have demonstrated that growing plants and the embryos (or  germ) within dry seeds have much in common at the cellular and  biochemical level. For example, certain proteins that accumulate  within the cells of growing plants during water-limitation are also  found in embryo cells during their normal maturation drying  process. Dehydrins are one such group of proteins and are the  focus of this research project. The basic question that will be  addressed by this rpoject is what role dehydrins play in adaptation  to cellular dehydration. The location of dehydrins within plant  cells will be determined, and blochemical tests of function will  be carried out on dehydrin protein that has been extracted from  plant cells. In addition, dehydrin genes will be examined in  normal and mutant plants. Through an understanding of the  fundamental biochemical role and genetics of dehydrins, it may be  possible in the longer term to design new strategies for the  development of plants with improved tolerance to environmental  stress.",a9205269,The Role of Dehydration-Induced Proteins in Plants,"August 1, 1992",$510000 (Estimated),Judith A.

Mycorrhizal fungi are present in  nearly all terrestrial ecosystems and have been shown to influence  nutrient uptake, growth and reproductive host plants under  controlled conditions. Unfortunately, very little is known about  the effects of mycorrhizal fungi on the population biology of their  host plants, particularly under field conditions. Experiments in  the laboratory have shown that mycorrhizal infection can increase  both fecundity and offspring quality. For example, it was shown  that infection of the maternal generation increased reproductive  output in the offspring generation. Therefore, the effects of  infection on maternal fecundity and offspring quality will be  assessed separately in the proposed study. A combination of field  and greenhouse experiments incorporating demographic and  physiological measurements is proposed to establish the mechanistic  basis for observed phenomena. In one study, maternal generation  host plants (Abutilon theophrasti) will be grown in the field in a  3 x 2 factorial experiment (3 levels of P amendment; mycorrhizal,  non-mycorrhizal). Growth, nutrient uptake, reproductive output,  leaf photosynthesis and root phosphatase activities will be  monitored for two seasons. In the second year of this study, a  third factor (natural reestablishment vs. thinning to a standard  density) will be incorporated in order to determine whether, in  addition to influencing fecundity, maternal treatments have  independent effects on offspring performance within the maternal  environment. In another 2 year study, seeds collected from mother  plants (from the various maternal treatments) will be transplanted  to another location in the field to determine whether interactions  between offspring environment (M/NM x high P/low P) and maternal  treatment (see above) exists for offspring vigor. Seeds collected  from mother plants will also be used in controlled greenhouse  studies in which the effects of maternal treatment on offspring  vigor mediated by seed weight will be distinguished from those  mediated by seed P content. In addition, greenhouse experiments in  which offspring from contrasting maternal treatments will be  allowed to interact will allow a determination as to whether  maternal treatment can influence competitive behavior.

The theoretical progress has been driven by  the statistical approach to sample fluctuations in the ensemble of  small disordered systems. As the sizes of the systems are made  smaller and smaller, eventually they approach the electron mean  free path. Then the motion of an electron becomes ballistic. On  the other hand, due to the complex geometry, this motion can still  be chaotic. Such a system is similar in many respects to other  systems (atomic or nuclear) which display quantum chaos. For  analytical calculations disordered systems turn out to be simpler  than chaotic ballistic ones because of the additional ensemble  averaging. The idea of this research is to use disordered systems  as a laboratory for the investigation of quantum chaos. In a  diffusive regime we plan to derive relations and develop analytical  methods which can be extended to general cases. Theoretical  studies will also be carried out on problems of persistent currents  in isolated rings and the magnetic susceptibility of isolated  metallic grains - problems closely connected to quantum chaos. We  will take into account interactions between electrons since  existing one-electron theories are in substantial disagreement with  experiment.  %%%  The field of mesoscopic physics is a very current one which deals  with basic problems in fundamental physics and yet has important  ramifications for microelectronics. The present research will  theoretically deal with a number of problems in mesoscopic physics.  In particular, the research will study the onset of quantum chaos  in these systems.

Chromosomal domains, consisting of chromatin loops  attached to the chromosomal scaffold, may provide a specialized  environment for gene expression. Supporting this hypothesis,  transgenes inserted at different loci in a plant genome very in  expression levels.

Around 1970, a black-grained biotype appeared as a weed  of row crops in the Midwest and in Canada. At least six other  crop-like biotypes are growing as weeds in row crops in Canada.  The recent colonization of North America by the black  biotype where it is frequently sympatric with crop and crop-like  weeds affords a unique opportunity to study evolution in the  early stages after colonization.  DNA molecular techniques are more sensitive to genetic  variation than are either allozyme electrophoresis or  morphological characters. The Principal Investigator will use  DNA molecular techniques in Barbara Schaal's lab in Washington  University to assess genetic relationships among biotypes,  measure genetic change in the black biotype as it has expanded  its range, and search for introgression between various weed  populations and crops. This study will shed light on the role of  genetic variation among populations of successful colonizing  species.

Bankruptcy rules affect firms in financial  distress in two ways. First, it is obvious that they affect the  outcome of the bankruptcy proceeding. Second, they establish the  alternative to an out-of-bankruptcy settlement and so affect the  nature of such settlements. The likely outcomes of both informal  bargaining and formal bankruptcy, in turn, affect the availability  of funds for investment and the types of investments equity holders  will pursue. More specifically, poorly conceived bankruptcy rules  may make it impossible for investors to earn a fair return, even  in situations where the investment is economically viable. Also,  bankruptcy rules may encourage or discourage inefficient  investments. Finally the bankruptcy regime affects the extent to  which firms are forced to liquidate assets even when the \"going  concern\" value of the assets is higher than the outstanding debt.  The purpose of the research is to guide the policy debate  surrounding bankruptcy by suggesting some features of an optimal  bankruptcy law based on these considerations.   The research method is novel in how it regards optimal bankruptcy  law as one element in the broader problem of designing optimal  financial contracts. Such contracts specify how resources are to  be allocated between investors and firms. Actual financial  contracts usually stipulate only (possibly contingent) payments to  investors. The rules governing the breach of stipulated promises  are, in fact, typically not specified in the contract explicitly.  They are generally contained in the legal system and are implicitly  a part of every contract. For example, debt contracts specify the  debtholder's investment, the specific payments to which he is  entitled, and covenants restricting the debtor's behavior.  Bankruptcy law provides a procedure to be followed if the promised  payments are not made or if the covenants are violated. In view  of this concern, security design will be examined as including both  explicit promises and the procedures to be followed in case of  breach, and optimal bankruptcy rules will be derived as part of an  overall contract design problem.",a9209722,Collaborative Research: The Design of Bankruptcy Procedures,"July 15, 1992",$96000 (Estimated),"Daniel H.

Recent research has shown that hybrid plant resistance to  herbivores may differ from resistance of pure parental plants to  herbivores. Hybrids could be more, less, equally, or  intermediately resistant compared to parental species. Determining  if one of these patterns is prevalent could contribute to  understanding important ecological and evolutionary aspects of  plant-herbivore interactions, as well as the role of hybrids in  considering issues of biological diversity. This project focuses  on willow species and their hybrids that co-occur in the same  habitat. The two parent willow species have different chemical  systems in their leaves that can be studied in the hybrids and  parents. The PI has developed molecular genetic markers to  characterize naturally occurring and crossed hybrids and parental  species. The PI will analyze the relationships between  hybridization, chemical variation and herbivore resistance for  field plants, and cloned and seedling plants in a common garden.  He will test if differences in chemical expression are correlated  with herbivore resistance of hybrids, and will use molecular  markers to determine the frequency of hybridization in several  communities that have both willow species.",a9208826,Collaborative Research: Genetic Analyses of Chemical Variation and Resistance to a Diverse Phytophage Community on Willow Hybrids,"January 1, 1993",$73427 (Estimated),Scott Collins  DEB DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY  BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"June 30, 1997 (Estimated)",Steven J.

This project is designed to investigate the roles  of T-protein, a huge protein that recently has been discovered as  a component of the extensively characterized intestinal epithelial  cell brush border cytoskeleton. Based on polypeptide molecular  weight, molecular morphology, and immunocrossreactivity, brush  border T-protein appears to be a nonmuscle isoform of the muscle  protein titin. Muscle titin is a key structural component  associated with the myosin thick filaments in sarcomeres.  Likewise, T-protein is co-localized with myosin in brush borders,  and T-protein and brush border myosin assemble into supramolecular  structures in vitro. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1)  determine the existence and structural organization of T-protein in  different domains of the intestinal epithelial cell brush border  cytoskeleton and in cytoskeletal structures, including stress  fibers, in other types of cells; 2) investigate the role of T-  protein in organizing brush border cytoskeletal assembly during  embryonic development of intestinal epithelial cells; and 3)  characterize interactions between T-protein and other cytoskeletal  components, including myosin. Results of these studies should  elucidate the importance of nonmuscle titin in governing the  organization of cytoskeletons and their ability to produce force  for critical cellular processes.  %%%  The most obvious form of movement in biological systems is muscular  motility. In muscle tissue, and particularly in skeletal muscle,  contractile behavior results in gross movements of organs, such as  the bending of an elbow or the turn of a head. These gross  movements are the composite result of intracellular movements of  protein complexes with respect to one another. The major  intracellular contractile proteins in muscle are actin and myosin,  which form oligomeric filaments that slide past each other in an  ATP-fueled controlled reaction that results in cellular shortening.  Whole muscles shorten (contract) as a composite result of the cells  within the muscle shortening. However, cellular and intracellular  movement is not limited to muscle tissue; virtually all types of  eukaryotic cells display various actin / myosin based motility  behaviors, ranging from cellular crawling to the separation of  daughter cells after mitosis. While the muscle system is quite  well understood in molecular detail, the extent to which these non-  muscle actin /myosin based motility systems resemble muscle, in  terms of molecular organization, is unclear. The Principal  Investigator has now identified a non-muscle version of a major  muscle protein which plays an important role in muscle actomyosin  based motility. The experiments which will be performed in this  project will elucidate the role played by the T-protein in non-  muscle motility, and will thereby contribute greatly to our general  understanding of cellular movement.",a9205198,Role of Titin in Nonmuscle Cytoskeletons,"July 15, 1992",$298750 (Estimated),Eve Ida Barak  MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"June 30, 1996 (Estimated)",Thomas C.

This has encouraged coastal nations to expand the  production capacity of their fisheries to service the  international market for marine products. This has led to an  emphasis on growth oriented comparative advantage approaches  involving large-scale projects, modern capital intensive  technology, and heavy injections of foreign and national capital.  One result of this activity has been to transfer priority away  from production for local markets to production for international  export. This project examines how these global level economic  processes have affected local fishing communities in coastal  India.

Diamond coatings for cutting tools, heat sinks for thermal management, and free- standing thick infrared (IR) optics are a few applications in which high deposition rates are crucial. Diamond deposition processes using a high power density microwave reactor were  developed in Phase I to obtain deposition rates of 15 um/hr. These rates are one order-of-magnitude larger than previously possible in similar systems operating at lower power. These Phase I results demonstrated that operation at high power densities opens a completely new operating regime for microwave  based deposition reactors. In this research, an experimental program is undertaken aimed at understanding the gas phase, chemistry changes at high power densities, to develop techniques to control film morphology, and to increase the growth rates to 50 um/hr.

They may have corners but  not cusps. These are effectively the minimal conditions one  might impose in physical representations where imprecise  measurements always lead to a loss of smoothness. Results on  homogeneous equations in any dimension are considered well  developed. Not so are the inhomogeneous problems. In fact, in  two dimensions there is a Dirichlet problem for which the  fundamental estimate comparing the gradient with the boundary  values does not hold.

This proposal is aimed at gaining a  greater understanding of these target recognition events, using  molecular biology, computer-enhanced imaging techniques, and  classical embryology.

The  investigator will look into the nature of group actions on the 2-  sphere and their extensions into the 3-ball. The main questions  he plans to consider are the following. (1) If M is irreducible,  N is laminated, and M and N are homotopy equivalent, are they  homeomorphic? (2) If M is laminated, then are homotopic  homeomorphisms isotopic? (3) What manifolds have essential  laminations? (4) If G is a 2-sphere convergence group which  extends to a properly discontinuous action on the 3-ball, is that  extension unique up to conjugation?  The study of 3-dimensional manifolds is aided by the fact  that our experience of living in such a space endows us with a  strong intuition for what can and cannot take place. Studying  the topology of higher dimensional manifolds is necessarily  dependent upon the algebraic machinery available to assist in it,  but in 3 dimensions we also have at our disposal a direct avenue  of perception. It is therefore surprising to learn that some  questions that have natural generalizations to higher dimensions  have been answered already for these higher cases, while the 3-  dimensional case that inspired them remains obdurately  unassailable. There is a classical conjecture of Poincare about  spheres that is the most notorious example of this phenomenon.  What appears to be at work in thus violating our natural over-  estimate of the advantage that geometric intuition should confer  in 3 dimensions? It is at least partly a naive faith in  intuition and mistrust of computation, but it is also the fact  that the known methods of computation perform best with the  luxury of excess dimensions in which to maneuver. They are  somehow cramped in the presence of only three dimensions.

The physical counterparts of such questions can be found in  studies of phase transition and wave front propagation.

Two lysosomal proproteases, procathepsins L and D, are  membrane associated at acidic pH in microsomal vesicles derived  from mouse fibroblasts. The binding, which is specific for the pro  but not the mature enzymes, is saturable and is mediated by a  factor which can be removed from the membranes by protease  treatment, suggesting that this is a specific interaction with a  receptor protein. As the association occurs at the pH at which  lysosomal enzymes are released from mannose-6-phosphate receptors,  the membrane association could be involved in protein sorting in  prelysosomes. Synthetic peptides based on the amino-terminal  sequence of procathepsin L will be used in binding assays to  establish which region of the capthepsin L propeptide associates  with membranes. Specific amino acids in the receptor binding  regions will be altered by site-directed mutagenesis. These  analyses will identify specific amino acids responsible for correct  subcellular targeting. Altered recombinant protein will be  expressed from an SV40 promoter in COS cells, isolated from cell  culture medium, and assayed for membrane binding ability.  Following this initial screen in which an altered protein is  identified with has lost its ability to associate with membranes in  a pH-dependent manner, an in vivo functional assay will be  performed. The cDNA plasmid will be expressed in HeLa cells which  have been demonstrated to target wild-type recombinant lysosomal  enzymes correctly.

These  degradations are catalyzed by proteolytic, glycosidic, and other  acid hydrolytic enzymes, which are contained within the lysosomes.  This project addresses the question of how the hydrolytic enzymes  get into the lysosomes. Some years ago, it was found that many  lysosomal enzymes shared a common oligosaccharide structure,  specifically a mannosyl-6-phosphate residue, which is recognized  and bound by two membrane bound man-6-P receptors. These receptors  traffic through the endosome-lysosome system and deliver bound  lysosomal enzymes to the endosomal-lysosomal compartment. However,  evidence has been accumulating in the literature that the man-6-P  receptors cannot account for all instances of lysosomal enzyme  targeting in cells. The discovery of a new lysosomal enzyme  binding membrane protein, which does not act via the man-6-P  residues on lysosomal enzymes, is therefore an important finding  which will undoubtedly broaden our view of how lysosomal enzymes  get into lysosomes.",a9204834,Lysosomal Proenzyme Sorting: A New Receptor,"November 1, 1992",$297466 (Estimated),Eve Ida Barak  MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"October 31, 1996 (Estimated)",Ann H.

It is hypothesized  that seedling recruitment during succession is strongly dependent on  both resource availability and heterogeneity. Specifically, it is  suggested that changes in canopy and gap structure, as successional  forests age, increase both light availability and light  heterogeneity at ground level. It is expected that species richness  of the regeneration pool is enhanced by both overall light  availability and the diversity of light environments represented in  older, structurally heterogeneous stands. Seedling recruitment is  further enhanced by availability of patches of disturbed soil  associated with gaps or animal activity. This interdisciplinary  approach integrates ecosystem-level studies of the patterns of  tropical forest succession with detailed analyses of within-stand  processes producing those patterns and studies of physiological and  growth responses of representative species.   Changes in forest composition and structure with be documented in  the species richness of seedlings, and in within-stand environmental  heterogeneity in a chronosequence of secondary and old-growth  premontane rain forests of northeastern Costa Rica. Detailed  measurements of the spatial variation of light availability, soil  disturbance, and litter cover in selected forests will be performed  along this chronosequence. The influence of distance to seed  sources on propagule diversity will be assessed in these stands by  sampling soil seed stocks in the study sites and by comparing the  diversity of seedlings and saplings as a function of distance from  seed sources. Investigators will experimentally examine the effects  of resource availability and heterogeneity on seedling establishment  and growth by manipulating light availability and soil disturbance  in a series of 15-25 year old stands. Light will be manipulated by  creating large and small canopy gaps and removing understory shrubs  in a replicated single-factor (4 treatments) design in which we will  assess the effects on natural seedling recruitment and species  richness. Additional manipulative studies in gaps and closed-canopy  sites will examine the interactive effects of light and soil  disturbance on natural seedling recruitment and the germination and  survival of seeds of selected species.   Experimental and observational field data will be used to model the  effects of stand structure and light availability of seedling  abundance and diversity using a spatial, mechanistic, simulation  model of forest dynamics. To evaluate the role of species-specific  differences in canopy light transmission within secondary forest, a  comparative study of canopy structure and light transmission will be  conducted for five abundant canopy tree species in the stands. The  model will also simulate the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the  diversity of seedling regeneration, based on measured  ecophysiological and growth responses of selected species. Model  inputs will be based on field data from representative stands within  the chronosequence. This modelling effort will integrate measured  organismal responses in the context of stand-level changes in  resource availability in tropical forests.

Solutions  of this type tend to a power of the radius; this power is often  referred to as the anomalous exponent. The phenomenon occurs in  many other examples as well. Recent work suggests methods for  calculating the precise value of the exponent. Knowledge of this  value measures the Holder continuity of solutions.

This simple example of organogenesis provides opportunities to  examine the interaction between genes that establish the overall  pattern of the embryo and those that direct tissue specific  development.

The goal of the current proposal is to identify  additional genes that act downstream from the pattern forming  genes to direct the morphogenesis and differentiation of the  glands. Three independent approaches will be used to identify  these new genes: analyzing enhancer trap lines, screening  deficiency mutant embryos for salivary defects, and searching for  downstream targets of the transcription factor encoded by the for  head gene. These methods should identify a new set of genes that  will help him characterize specific steps in salivary  development.

The long term objective is to reconstruct the  evolutionary pathway that has historically been followed to lead  to diverse nematode forms. The aim is to identify and describe in  molecular terms the genetic events that underlie the evolution of  developmental programs. Evolution of the tail fan developmental  program will be studied by comparing the cellular mechanisms of  fan development in C. elegans with that in four other free living  nematode species. The fan is chosen for these studies because its  morphology varies widely among nematode species. Cells  responsible for making the fan will be identified by cell  ablation experiments in C. elegans. Development of the fan will  be studied by tracing cell lineages, defining the positions of  epidermal cells by indirect immunofluorescence staining with a  monoclonal antibody to a cell junctional antigen, and by direct  light microscopic observation. Points of evolutionary divergence  will be identified in the various stages of fan differentiation.  A phylogenetic tree indicating the evolutionary relationships of  the nematode species studies will be constructed from sequences  of the small ribosomal subunit genes. In order to identify genes  that may have played a role in evolution of the fan, mutants of  C. elegans with abnormal fans will be analyzed.

These strata also form part of the  standard reference section of the North American Ordovician time  scale as well as the reference standard for the conodont and  graptolite biozonations commonly used for temporal correlation in  this interval. The goal of the research is to employ geochemical  fingerprinting of unaltered phenocrysts within the K-bentonites  together with new and detailed studies of the ranges of graptolite  and conodont species to integrate these separate stratigraphies  into a unified chronostratigraphic network.  We propose to accomplish this by 1) establishing precise ties  between the graptolite zones and the North Atlantic and  midcontinent conodont zones based on detailed collecting of range  data from numerous measured sections that each span the facies  transition from Trenton Group carbonates into the Utica Shale and  2) establishing precise ties between the laterally equivalent  siliciclastic and carbonate facies based on the identification of  synchronous time planes through geochemical fingerprinting of the  K-bentonites. The techniques to be employed for K-bentonite  correlation include analysis of 1) major and trace element  composition of melt inclusions within quartz phenocrysts.  Additionally, we propose to use high precision U-Pb zircon  geochronometry to calibrate our chronostratigraphy.  The resulting chronostratigraphy will provide a temporal  framework, calibrated in years, that will provide a direct test of  the accuracy of the existing graptolite and conodont  biostratigraphies as well as sequence stratigraphic and  coenocorrelation studies of these rocks. This chronostratigraphy  will constitute the temporal framework necessary for studies of the  rate of evolution among graptolites and other organisms that occur  in the studied sections. Simultaneously, the K-bentonite  geochemical and geochronological data will provide unique insights  about the tectonic provenance of these altered volcanic ash beds  and the nature and duration of Taconic orogenic events.",a9204931,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Integrated Biostratigraphy and K-Bentonite Chronostratigraphy in the Ordovician of the Northern Appalachian Basin: Geochemical and Geochrono......,"June 15, 1992",$58613 (Estimated),Christopher G.

Areas of concern include  dynamical systems, nonlinear partial differential equations and  geometry. The methods, both analytical and topological, are  rooted in previous work; in particular on variational problems in  which compactness assumptions are not available.  Among the topics to be investigated is symbolic dynamics, in  which the contribution of the periodic orbits provided by the  Birkhoff-Lewis theorem connects the framework used in dynamical  systems with that used in variational theory. A particular goal  is to carry over existing work to the case where the stable and  unstable manifolds of a hyperbolic fixed point intersect  transversely. This situation arises frequently in the study of  dynamical systems, for example in the restricted three-body  problem.  Related work will be carried out on collisions and existence  of periodic orbits of three-body type. It is planned to  establish the existence of infinitely many generalized solutions  and to demonstrate that these solutions have good properties,  i.e. that one can attach to each of them a Morse index which  describes the difference of topology that they induce in the  level sets of the variational problem.

Very little is known about the molecular composition of  the Golgi in plants. Few of the enzymes involved in the synthesis  of cell wall matrix polysaccharides have been identified and  characterized. Nothing is known about the organization of these  enzymes within the Golgi, or how such organization is maintained,  or how polysaccharide synthesis is initiated, or how complex  polysaccharides are assembled and targeted to specific locations in  the cell wall. Part of the difficulty has been an inability to  subfractionate plant Golgi into cis-, medial, and trans-cisternal  elements. A novel approach is proposed to achieve such separation,  in which a chimaeric protein (translational fusion between the E1  glycoprotein of avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus, IBV-E1, and GUS)  will be used to target the manipulable GUS marker to the Golgi.  This idea is based on observations in animal systems that IBV-E1 is  targeted to and accumulates in the membranes of the cis-Golgi  cisternae. In this project, the ultrastructural location of  chimaeric markers containing all or part of the IBV-E1 coding  sequence will be determined by EM colloidal gold immunolocalization  (to be done in collaboration with experts in this technique).  These studies will establish the feasibility of more extensive  biochemical work exploiting the IBV-E1 fusion expressed in plant  cells.  %%%  A large fraction of the dry weight of plants is in the cell walls.

They are  the biological sources of significant commercial products, such as  cellulose and cellulose-based products, wood products, and dietary  fiber. This novel approach to understanding the cell biology of  plant wall biosynthesis may open up the possibility of genetic  engineering of plant walls for specific purposes.

This  characterization will include determination of the kinetic  constants and driving force for UDP-galactose transport. The UDP-  N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-galactose transporters will be  solubilized and reconstituted into liposomes, as a first step  toward the ultimate purification of these transporter proteins. A  cDNA encoding for the UDP-galactose transporter will be isolated  utilizing an expression cloning strategy to clone by  complementation analysis using a chinese hamster ovary cell mutant  which is defective in UDP-galactose transport.  %%%  Glycoconjugates, including glycoproteins and glycolipids, are  critical to the life of all cells. They are synthesized by the  stepwise addition of covalently linked simple sugars to nascent  structures (proteins or lipids). These reactions generally proceed  by the transfer of the sugar moiety from a biosynthetic activated  precursor, or nucleotide-sugar, to the nascent glycoconjugate. In  eukaryotes, these glycosyltransfer reactions usually take place  within the lumens of intracellular membrane-bounded compartments  (e.g. endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus). Most nucleotide  sugars (e.g., UDP-galactose, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine) are  synthesized in the cytosol, and because of their ionic charge,  cannot passively diffuse across a biological membrane. Therefore,  specific transporters exist in the intracellular membranes which  effect the translocation of the nucleotide sugar precursors from  the cytosol into the lumen. This project focuses on the transport  of UDP-galactose across the Golgi apparatus membrane, and in  particular on the biochemical description of the membrane  transporter. The work will lead to the eventual understanding of  how this class of transport protein operates, and also will further  our understanding of the functions and organization of the Golgi  apparatus, a subcellular organelle which plays a central role in  protein sorting and secretion, and in the biosynthesis of  glycoproteins and glycolipids. The results of these studies may  have practical application in engineering cells to produce various  specific glycoconjugates on a commercial scale.",a9207142,Uridine Nucleotide Sugar Transport into the Golgi Apparatus,"October 15, 1992",$450509 (Estimated),Eve Ida Barak  MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"March 31, 2000 (Estimated)",Barbara C.

Among these are nonlinear  autoregressive (-moving average) processes of much interest in  time series analysis, and random perturbations of dynamical  systems and flows which exhibit various phase transitions as a  parameter changes. The interplay between Markov processes and  dynamical systems that this proposal explores has significant  consequences to both fields. For those Markov processes which  approach a unique steady state as time progresses, a further  object of study is the central limit theorem and its refinement  by asymptotic expansions. These refinements have applications in  diverse areas such as bootstrapping in time series, and singular  perturbation expansions of large time solutions of a class of  partial differential equations which arise in the prediction of  the spread of contaminants in an aquifer.  Random processes which occur in nature may often be regarded  as a deterministic system perturbed by random noise. Just as the  nature of the deterministic part greatly influences the behavior  of the random process, the statistical behavior of the random  process may also be used in predicting the large time behavior of  the deterministic system itself. This latter study is  particularly useful in analyzing complex deterministic systems  such as those arising in the study of turbulence. The present  proposal seeks to explore this interplay between deterministic  and random processes. Another object is the refinement of  precise statistical laws governing the long-run average behavior  of many important random phenomena.

The investigator will  continue to work on the analysis of priority arguments in the  theory of recursively enumerable degrees and on the proof-theoretic  strength of these arguments. Groszek and Theodore A. Slaman (Univ.  of Chicago) have been developing a uniform presentation for all  levels of priority argument and tying these arguments to a standard  proof-theoretic hierarchy of fragments of Peano arithmetic. In  addition to continuing this development, Groszek will investigate  specific statements about the partial order of recursively  enumerable Turing degrees, considering whether and how their proof-  theoretic strength reflects this analysis. In a different vein,  Groszek will work on some long-standing open questions regarding  the degrees of constructibility. Finally, she will consider the  question of which partial orders can be embedded into the Turing  degrees (assuming the failure of CH), one of the remaining open  questions about the global structure of the Turing degrees.  Prominent among the questions to be addressed by this project  are a number that bear on theoretical computability. They lie in  what is known as recursion theory, which deals with a model of  computability knowing no bounds on time or space.

The first provides methods for the  empirical implementation of models of aggregate dynamics under  heterogeneous and discontinuous microeconomic adjustment, and  develops several applications.

The second part of the project is more specific and is aimed at  studying the dynamic and medium run implications of the presence  of costs of creating new production units in a growing economy.

Part of  this research will be conducted by the investigators separately and  part will be conducted jointly. A main line of research for  Jackson continues the development of the structural theory for the  model L(R) assuming determinacy. This includes pushing the current  theory further, as well as refining the theory at the projective  levels. Jackson will also work on problems in other areas of set  theory. The investigators will work jointly on problems in  descriptive set theory, the theory of equivalence relations, and  problems both set-theoretic and topological in nature. Some  examples include the determinacy transfer problem at the odd  levels, questions about metrizable continua with sigma-finite  linear Hausdorff measure, and the existence of natural norms on  K(X), the n-dimensional kernel of a complex metric space. Mauldin  will also investigate some problems in the theory of random  homeomorphisms, for example: for one natural method for producing  circle homeomorphisms, do almost all homeomorphisms of the unit  circle have periodic orbits? Are there natural methods which  produce homeomorphisms with irrational rotation numbers?  Considering that the real numbers can be thought of as the  ordinary number line of grade school arithmetic, it is surprising  how much structure can be imposed upon them and how intricate the  questions that can be asked about this structure. Descriptive set  theory is the theory that addresses these questions with all the  machinery of modern mathematical logic. For example, a standard  construct of this theory is the Borel hierarchy of sets, consisting  of two infinite sequences of families of sets, the Pi sets and the  Sigma sets, defined inductively, and hence of increasing  complexity. One of the obvious applications of the theory is to  locate precisely in this hierarchy a particular set which arises in  analysis, say the set of points at which a function is  differentiable. In fact, it is a typical and classical theorem of  descriptive set theory (due to Mazurkiewicz) that any such set of  differentiability belongs to the family Pi-one-one in the Borel  hierarchy.

Here we propose an  experimental test of both types of the theory. Maintenance  theories that assume a role for recombination in generating rare  useful genotypes will be tested by competing diploid yeast strains  with each other, strains that differ only in their ability to  undergo recombination. The experimental design will permit two  classes of these models to be examined, those that assume selection  coefficients are constant (the Fisher-Muller models of  Felsenstein's classification (Felsenstein, 1988)) and those that  assume they are variable or cyclic (Felsenstein's Sturtevant-Mather  models). Both processes are likely to be important; we will  attempt to determine which is more powerful in our experimental  system. Asexual strains will be competed directly with isogenic  sexual one, to determine the range of conditions under which  strains what are capable of recombining sexually prevail. The type  of genetic variability that accumulates under these conditions, and  the rate at which it accumulates, will also be measured. The  origin of sex theory that will be tested is the DNA repair  hypothesis of Bernstein and Michod. We will test to see whether  the ability to recombine meiotically confers a competitive  advantage upon sexual strains to ionizing radiation, which induces  double strands and breaks. Double stranded breaks are essential to  the DNA repair hypothesis, which postulates that in early biotic  environments, double stranded breaks imposed sever selection  pressures upon organisms. The only way to repair such breaks was  in certain lineages. We will also examine whether, and how  quickly, increased rates of recombination can be selected for in  heavily mutagenized populations that either do or do not exhibit an  alternation of generations, and whether this selection can affect  both mitotic and meiotic recombination.",a9205092,Using Saccharomyces to Examine Models of Biparental Genomic Recombination,"December 15, 1992",$185000 (Estimated),Therese A.

A major goal of Wilkerson's research is to complete the  classification of finite loop spaces as a generalization of compact  Lie group theory. The tools are function complexes and  calculations with the Steenrod algebra going back to work of Adams-  Wilkerson, Miller, Carlsson, and Lannes. Part of the work  generalizes known facts about group actions and fixed points to  homotopy fixed points. Smith seeks an explicit construction of the  Morava K-theories. These homology theories play a vital role in  the Devinatz-Hopkins-Smith nilpotence theorem. Previous  constructions rely on geometric techniques which are hard to  interpret homotopically. The resulting classifying spaces can  really be constructed only \"up to homotopy,\" leaving many questions  about their nature open. Finally, in joint work with S. Jackowski  and R. Oliver, McClure intends to try to find a simplified proof of  the immersion conjecture. His other three problems all involve  some aspect of the theory of topological Hochschild homology.  The details of these three parts vary, but all are concerned  either with reducing geometric information to a subject for  calculation or to perfecting one of the principal algebraic tools  used for this purpose. The nature of the geometric information  involved is the crux of the difficulty. While questions about  lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth virtually cry out to  be reduced to calculations, it is far different with what are known  as topological properties of geometric objects. These are  properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece),  knottedness, having no holes, and so forth. All systematic study  of such properties, for example, how to tell whether two geometric  objects really differ in respect to one of these properties or are  only superficially different, or how to classify the variety of  differences that can occur, all these have only truly been  comprehended and mastered when they have been reduced to matters of  calculation.",a9207731,Mathematical Sciences: Function Complexes And The Steenrod Algebra In Homotopy Theory,"September 1, 1992",$275000 (Estimated),Ralph M.

Instead,  responding often begins slowly, increases to a peak and then  decreases through the rest of the session. The present  experiments will begin to determine under what conditions these  within-session changes in responding occur. They will also begin  to determine why these changes occur. In particular, the  experiments will try to separate the contribution of factors  related to reinforcement, such as satiation, from factors related  to responding, such as fatigue. They will try to separate the  contribution of central factors, such as focusing of attention,  from factors at the periphery, such as interference from  competing responses. They will try to separate the effect of  factors that accumulate over the session, such as fatigue, from  the anticipation of things to come, such as the return to the  home cage at the end of the session.   These experiments are theoretically important because rate of  responding averaged over the session is one of the primary  dependent variables in operant psychology. Finding systematic  changes in responding within sessions suggests that this measure  ignores important changes in behavior at a more fine-grained  level. The research is methodologically important because many  experiments are not designed so that their data can be  interpreted if such within-session changes in responding occur.  Improving theory and methodology in operant psychology is  important for applied reasons.

Quantum yields for the mineralization of a model reactant  mixture consisting of trichloroethylene, water, oxygen, and  inert carrier gas on titania heterojunction photocatalysts,  with the reactants delivered as vapors or gases, are  correlated with the charge-carrier separation distances; the  charge-carrier separation distance, in turn is a function of  the composition and configuration of the heterojunction.

Biologically, this  export feeds most deeper dwelling organisms, and chemically it  influences the exchange of gases like carbon dioxide and oxygen  with the atmosphere. Export usually is defined in terms of carbon.  A common approach is to estimate carbon export from a limiting  nutrient such as the new (nitrate) component of total plankton  production by assuming that 6.6 atoms of carbon are exported for  each atom of new production. However, this gear ratio (one of the  Redfield ratios) between the surface water carbon and nitrogen  cycles has never been rigorously examined. Recent measurements in  diverse ocean areas indicate that the net change in inorganic  carbon associated with new production exceeds that predicted from  the Redfield conversion by more than 50%. Thus, current concepts  or nutrient cycling in the ocean may be seriously flawed and the  role or the ocean as a carbon sink and as an O2 source may be  significantly underestimated. This research represents the first  quantitative study of the relationship between new production and  net production in terms of both dissolved inorganic carbon and O2  with incubation experiments that can isolate the biological  processes from the confounding effects of mixing and gas exchange.  These experiments will provide critical relationships that are  needed for more accurate estimates of oceanic carbon and oxygen  fluxes.

It contains a  sequence of nonmarine deposits about 12,000 feet thick that ranges  in age from about 5 to 0.7 Ma, yields remains of fossil mammals  throughout the sequence, and contains lithologies amenable to  magnetostratigraphic and isotopic age analysis. The deposits, the  Mt. Eden and San Timoteo formations, occur in well exposed outcrops  of an anticline that plunges gently northwestward and is truncated  on its southwestern edge by the currently active San Jacinto fault.  The San Jacinto, the most active strand of the San Andreas fault  system in southern California, underwent about 24 km of right slip  during the past two million years. Paleocurrent data indicate that  the sediments were transported to the San Timoteo basin from the  north and northeast. Distinctive clast suites in the rocks are  consistent with derivation from sources in those directions now  northeast of the Badlands; some east of the present San Andreas  fault (s.s). The San Timoteo beds thus are ideally situated in  space and time to promote investigations of the slip history of  elements of the San Andreas fault system during the past 5 million  years. These beds are the only sequence that accumulated  relatively continuously during this span of time in this part of  southern California.  A detailed analysis of age of these beds has never been  attempted. The program of age analysis will include vertebrate  paleontology and biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy and isotope  chronology. If successful, the results will dramatically improve  our ability to attempt a reconstruction of the sedimentary history  of the San Timoteo beds, and palinspastic reconstructions of the  tectonic block that contains them relative to the then adjacent  terranes in this region. The data also will be valuable in  addressing the timing of transfer of regional slip from the San  Andreas fault strands (s.s) to the San Jacinto fault, will improve  our ability to evaluate when and how the entire San Andreas system  became effectively \"locked\" in this region; will sharpen the focus  of local investigations of slip rates on the San Andreas, and on  how regional shear between the Pacific and American plates is  propagated through the Transverse Ranges province.",a9205023,"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Neogene Sediments of the San Timoteo Badlands, Southern California: Tectonic Implications Along the San Andreas and San Jacinto Faults","July 15, 1992",$90000 (Estimated),Christopher G.

Host-parasite interactions may promote species  diversity, alter host behavior, contribute to speciation and  perhaps foster and maintain sex. My research uses a common  arthropod parasite to investigate host-parasite coevolution. The  parasite is a cytoplasmically transmitted bacterium that causes  reproductive incompatability. Crosses between infected males and  uninfected females are sterile. By \"sterilizing\" females not  transmitting the parasite, infected males increase the frequency of  infection and the parasite should spread until all individuals are  infected. Two questions about host-parasite coevolution are  addressed. Is there genetic variation for parasite-induced affects  on host reproductive success? A genetic analysis measures the  heritability of the parasite's effect on the host reproductive  success. The response to selection (R) depends on selection (S)  and heritability (h2), R=S*h2. Thus this experiment elucidates the  potential of the host-parasite system to evolve. The second  question is: How does parasite virulence evolve? Novel parasite  strains will be introduced into different host genetic backgrounds.  The parasite's effects on the host will be measured over long and  short term.

His goal is to understand how ensete (Ensete  ventricosum) or \"false banana\" was domesticated and incorporated  into Ethiopian subsistence practices. He will conduct two months  of fieldwork in this area which is both archaeologically unknown  and in the heart of the present region of ensete use. He will  locate promising areas on the basis of both local interview and  analysis of areal photographs and satellite imagery. In  particular, he will focus on caves and rock shelters because the  potential for locating stratified deposits is greatest there.  Limited test excavations will be conducted and a basic cultural  sequence established. With this data it will then be possible to  plan longer term field research.   While the archaeology of the Ethiopian highlands is poorly known,  modern botanic data suggest that this region served as point of  origin for many widely used African domesticates. Ensete is a  large, fibrous, tree-like monocot which closely resembles a  banana. Unlike the banana, however, the fruits are inedible and  the main sources of food are the roots, pseudo-stems and left-  stems. Although wild species of ensete are distributed  throughout much of central, eastern and southern Africa,  evidently it is only in Ethiopia that domesticated varieties are  cultivated. Ensete is either baked or made into porridge and is  eaten by about one fifth of Ethiopia's estimated 10,000,000  people. Various parts of the plant are also used for fodder, fuel  and packing material. Almost nothing is known about the  development of ensente use and Dr. Brandt's research should  provide needed basic data.   This project is important for several reasons. It will provide  insight into the processes which led to the original  domestication of plants and animals. Ethiopia is prone to  drought and human starvation and hopefully greater understanding  of indigenous farming techniques which have stood the test of  time) may provide new ways to attack this problem.

Many important materials are synthesized by this general  family of techniques, including semiconducting and insulating  films, and diamond films for wear hardening and optical uses.   This project is a multidisciplinary collaborative effort  designed to study growth mechanisms of CVD of diamond and  related films. Recent measurements have demonstrated that the  morphology of CVD grown diamond films is very sensitive to  activation and growth conditions. In order to rationally  control the growth process a link is necessary between the  structure of the films produced and the chemistry that is  taking place in the growth reactor. To address this, three  aspects of the CVD growth process are explored: identification  of the gas phase species present in the boundary layer above  the substrate, determination of the species present on the  substrate surface and surface of the grown film, and  structural determination of the film morphology. Laser  ionization and secondary ion mass spectrometries, surface  vibrational spectroscopy, and electron and optical  microscopies will be used for these determinations. The  results from these studies are expected to contribute to  development of a fundamental understanding of how gas-phase  and surface chemistry influence the composition, growth rate,  and structural properties of the films produced.

The division of labor between the kernel and the user level is different on a multiprocessor than on a uniprocessor.  On a uniprocessor, the kernel is responsible for address spaces, communication, resource allocation, threads, and thread scheduling. On a shared memory multiprocessor, the kernel iis left in charge of address spaces and resource allocation, but communication, threads, and thread scheduling are implemented at user level through runtime support in each address space.  Furthermore, each address space is in direct control over certain key aspects of virtual memory management and file management. It is important to understand that while ``micro-kernel'' designs such as Mach 3.0 take the important step of moving the file system, the virtual memory system, etc., out of the kernel to user-level servers, they leave cross-address space communication, threads, and thread scheduling in the kernel. There are structural differences between these monolithic kernels, micro-kernel designs and the ``nano-kernel'' advocated here. In experimental work over the past several years, the researchers have constructed proof-of-concept prototypes in most of the essential areas that must be addressed: locking protocols, user-level threads, cross-address space communication, the kernel interface, processor allocation policies, and user-level virtual memory management. The  objectives in this work are of two kinds, direct and indirect. Direct objectives include: (1) integrating these proof-of-concept prototypes into a single system, convincingly demonstrating the viability of the overall approach; and (2) solving the problems that stand in the way of this  integration, some of which are known and some of which can only be discovered by undertaking the task. Indirect objectives include: (a) using the ``core'' of the resulting system to study a number of important policy questions (thread scheduling, processor allocation, virtual memory management) that can  only be explored given such an experimental testbed, and (b) using this core as a base for exploring high performance system support for more advanced architectures, specifically large scale machines with distributed memory, distributed/parallel programming using high band-width low-latency networks, and wide-address machines.",a9200832,System Support for High Performance Computing,"September 1, 1992",$1599262 (Estimated),CCR DIV OF COMPUTER-COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH  CSE DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR,"August 31, 1997 (Estimated)",Edward D.

(a) Group Knowledge: In recent years, the PI has come to believe that what we call knowledge is more algorithmic than semantic, i.e., on the basis of what one learns, one then carries out certain probabilistic algorithms and the `information` does not tell us about the state of the world, but tells us rather that certain algorithms are likely to be beneficial. (b) Reasoning about Topology and Computation: In joint work with Larry Moss, the PI shows how standard topological concepts can be formalized in a modal logic of knowledge. The point of this work is to suggest that simple aspects of topological reasoning are also connected with special-purpose logics of knowledge. (c) Legal Reasoning: There has recently been substantial interest in applying dynamic logic to legal reasoning. One sets up some domain of possible worlds where the situation is not merely factual but also has a legal aspect. However, Dynamic logic allows one only to look at the  actions of one agent. As is obvious to anyone who reads the newspaper, there are many legal situations involving two or more individuals. (d) Non-monotonic Logics of Knowledge. An example of such a problem is: suppose it is given that 1 < a < b are factors of 6. One can then know that a = 2, b = 3.

Cercosporin produces singlet oxygen when activated by  light and is toxic to a wide variety of organisms, including mice,  plants, bacteria and many fungi. However, Cercospora species  produce high concentrations of this compound in the light and are  unaffected by its presence. Published evidence suggests that the  production of carotenoids and the ability of Cercospora fungi to  reduce and detoxify the cercosporin molecule are the primary  mechanisms of resistance to the toxin. This project tests the  hypothesis for the involvement of carotenoids in cercosporin  detoxification through the generation of a series of carotenoid-  deficient mutants produced by gene disruption experiments. Mutants  that are either sensitive to cercosporin or deficient in  cercosporin-reducing ability will provide alternative means to test  for possible mechanisms of detoxification.  %%%  Naturally-occurring toxins are usually without effect in the  cells in which they are produced, yet they can be potent poisons in  the cells of closely-related organisms. The cellular mechanisms of  detoxification in toxin-producing organisms are thought to involve  either the chemical modification that results in the inactivation  of the toxin or the compartmentalization of the active toxin  molecules away from targets elsewhere in the cell. The chemical  basis for cercosporin toxicity is understood and the inactivation  of cercosporin through its chemical reduction is thoroughly  reasonable.

However, ligament structures, as recently redefined  by Waller (1990) and Carter (1990a), remain poorly known for many  extinct as well as extant bivalves, and data of shell  microstructure have lagged behind other aspects of comparative  anatomy because of the persistence of an inadequate descriptive  nomenclature, a paucity of data for Paleozoic and Mesozoic  families, and the lack of an accurate, comprehensive perspective  on evolutionary pathways and convergence. Carter (1990a) recently  demonstrated that new data of subclasses Palaeotaxodonta,  Pteriomorphia and Isofilibranchia can provide significant new  insights into family and higher level evolutionary relationships.  The proposed research will extend this database to include the  remaining bivalve subclasses Heteroconchia and Anomalodesmata, and  it will use the entire database for the Bivalvia in conjunction  with published and new data of shell morphology, hinge dentition,  shell musculature, gill, palp, pedal and stomach structure, and all  other pertinent aspects of hard and soft anatomy to provide the  first truly comprehensive, family-cladistic analysis of this entire  class.

Competing parsimonious cladograms will be evaluated from the  perspective of traditional stratophenetics.  In addition to providing new perspectives on evolutionary  convergence in shell and ligament microstructure and ligament  structure, this research is expected to resolve many important but  previously intractable questions of bivalve evolution, including  the early diversification of shell microstructure in the Bivalvia,  the origin of porcelaneous structures in the Veneroida, possible  diphyletic origins of the Crassatelloidea, the origin of the myoid  superfamilies, and the evolution of porcelaneous microstructures  and asymmetrical ligaments in the Anomalodesmata.

When the data  may not be well behaved, applied statisticians and other  practitioners should be able to obtain robust estimates of  individual effects, accompanied by suitable summaries and  aggregate measures of variability. By adding substantially to  the limited number of available small-sample results that apply  to the summaries and aggregates required for robust ANOVA, this  project aims to provide the basis (including critical tables) for  a unified body of basic inferential techniques for one-way and  two-way layouts.  For data that fail to satisfy the standard assumptions (for  example, by containing some anomalous observations or by having  heavy tails), ANOVA-like procedures are needed that perform well  across a broad range of underlying distributions. A number of  proposed robust procedures for the more general class of linear  models, which also includes regression, may be applied in ANOVA  situations, but evidence on their performance in small samples  is still too limited to permit choice of a preferred technique or  to make the necessary components (including estimates of effects  and their standard errors, corresponding tests of hypotheses,  and detailed critical tables) available for statistical  applications. The proposed research will investigate several  procedures for robust ANOVA, mainly based on M-estimation,  using large-sample results and Monte Carlo to establish their  properties in small samples.

The first  application will focus on algebras of linear operators generated  by those of Calderon-Zygmund type. These operators arise in the  analysis of partial differential equations. The operators are  too complex to study individually; the goal of current research  is to choose wavelet bases in which the operators may be  represented as almost-diagonal matrices. From this  representation, one can read off many hidden properties of the  operators. A second line of investigation concerns wavelet  decompositions in higher dimensional space. This work will begin  with the representation of radial functions in term of wavelets  which somehow respect the symmetry. The fundamental difficulty  is that one cannot symmetrize one-dimensional wavelets and  maintain the desired translation properties. Some progress has  been made in developing a new wavelet-type function with many  desirable properties preserved. A third direction of this  research is that of distinguishing the behavior of the different  Riesz transforms on functions spaces using wavelet-type  representations.  Wavelet theory has introduced an extraordinary new tool into  the field of harmonic analysis. It contains the elements of a  highly effective theoretical method for the representation of  functions along with natural algorithms for the computation of  various expansions of functions which are simultaneously local in  time and frequency.

Mutations of the su(s) gene elevate the  expression levels of three vermilion (v) mutants. These v mutants  have insertions of a retrotransposon in the first exon of the v  gene. The transposon insertion in this position behaves as a large  intron and is spliced from the precursor RNA at cryptic sites near  the ends of transposon sequences. Experimental observations  indicate that su(s) mutations increase the stability of these  transcripts. Two models are being proposed to explain the  observations. First, RNA stability could be increased if su(s)  mutations enhance spliceosome formation at cryptic sites, thereby  unspliced RNAs would be stabilized and allowed more time for  splicing to occur. Thus, su(s) might encode a component of the  splicing machinery. Alternatively, su(s) could encode a protein  involved in targeting nuclear RNAs for degradation, suggesting that  su(s) might play a direct role in controlling the stability of  specific transcripts. The objectives of this proposal are the  following. (1) To establish whether the response of v mutants to  su(s) mutations depends on splicing at the cryptic sites, these  splice sites will be altered (e.g., eliminated and improved) by  site specific mutagenesis. After transformation of these  derivatives into the Drosophila germ line, expression will be  examined in su(s) wild type and mutant backgrounds. (2) To develop  an in vitro assay for su(s) activity, nuclear extracts will be  prepared from su(s) wild type and mutant embryos and tested by in  vitro splicing, spliceosome assembly, and RNA degradation assays.  (3) To examine the biochemical properties of the su(s) protein,  anti-su(s) antibodies will be used to determine whether the protein  fractionates with spliceosomes or if it binds to RNA.  Furthermore, attempts will be made to partially purify the protein  from either embryos or cultured cells that have been engineered to  over express the protein.  %%%  These studies will provide new information about RNA processing  control mechanisms in eukaryotes.",a9205425,Control of RNA Processing Drosophila,"August 1, 1992",$424750 (Estimated),MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"January 31, 1996 (Estimated)",Lillie L.

Magnetic surveys over  large areas of the crust have been used to infer both the  composition and structure of subsurface crust. Large regions of  crust exhibit high-amplitude magnetic anomalies implying crustal  magnetization values much higher than those actually observed in  laboratory measurements on small samples of crustal rocks. Part of  the discrepancy between these laboratory based measurements of  magnetization in individual samples and what is measured above  large crustal areas is thought to arise from the current inability  of laboratory instrumentation to measure the magnetization of rocks  acquired over time under the high-temperature-pressure conditions  ambient inside the Earth's crust.

In recent years, considerable effort  has been devoted toward understanding the regulation and functions  of microtubules in the axon. In contrast, dendritic microtubules  are poorly studied. The experiments in this application will  explore the role of MAP-2, a somatodendritic-specific  microtubule-associated protein in the organization and stability  properties of dendritic microtubules. Other experiments will  explore the potential role of microtubules in regulating organelle  transport in the dendrite. These studies will resolve important  issues about dendritic microtubules, and will thereby provide new  insights into the mechanisms that generate and maintain neuronal  polarity. Information of this kind is essential for understanding  the cell biology of the neuron, and for elucidating the causes and  potential cures for neuropathologies involving retardation of  dendritic growth, and/or loss of neuronal polarity.",a9209939,Studies on Dendritic Microtubules,"April 15, 1993",$214200 (Estimated),IBN DIV OF INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY AND NEUROSCIE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"March 31, 1996 (Estimated)",Peter W.

In  particular they propose to investigate an approach that offers  (i) a wide range of concurrency control mechanisms including  serializable transactions and interactive transactions; (ii)  fine-grain access control for collaborative applications that  allows a user to recover from other users' mistakes and explore  various alternatives with them, (iv) a multidimensional  inheritance model that allows collaboration parameters to be  specified independently in hierarchies of groups of objects and  groups of users; and (v) multimedia support integrated with  concurrency control, access control, and undo/redo. The unique  features of this research are its focus on the relationships of  these five goals, on flexible mechanisms for achieving each of  the goals, and on structured specification of options by  end-users. The researchers will use results from previous  research done in flexible coupling, long transactions, adaptive  concurrency control systems. inheritance, single-user undo/redo,  capability-based protection, collaborative tools, and software  engineering tools, They plan to implement the approach by  extending an existing system developed at Purdue and Minnesota.

Maximum effects  are expected in the marginal ice zone where phytoplankton blooms  extend from May to September as the ice recedes northwards.  These productive waters can cover more than half the area of  arctic shelf seas, such as the Barents Sea, in any one growth  period. One of the main components of the phytoplankton at the  marginal ice zone is Phaeocystis pouchetii which, in its colonial  form, is a high producer of DMS. This species is known to  excrete a high proportion of newly fixed carbon as high molecular  weight polymers in order to form the colony. Later, it sinks in  mass in the latter stages of the bloom when nitrate becomes  limiting. Diatoms, such as Thalassiosira gravida, may dominate  the bloom at the ice edge late in the summer and may also precede  the P. pouchetii bloom in early spring (i.e. Chaetoceros  socialis). The different patterns of dissolved organic carbon  formation and cell sedimentation between P. pouchetii and diatoms  need to be included in productivity models for an understanding  of the production and sink of CO2 and DMS in arctic shelf areas.

The nature of cytoskeletal changes caused by  expression in oocytes of pp60src with constitutive kinase  activity will be examined. The pattern of tyrosine  phosphorylation in oocytes producing kinase-constitutive pp60src  is altered when such oocytes are made to reenter the cell cycle  by progesterone treatment. Activation of the oocyte's endogenous  maturation promoting factor (MPF) by microinjection of cyclin  mRNA will be used to examine whether MPF is responsible for this  change in substrate pattern. Immunochemical and biochemical  methods will be used to determine whether changes in pp60src  distribution or modification accompany the change in substrate  pattern.

Recently, research on  molecular recognition (generated by weak, non-covalent  interactions) has been recognized worldwide as an important  intellectual and technological frontier. Endo- (generated by  convergent cavities) and exo (generated by larger bodies of similar  size and shapes, or surfaces) molecular recognition,  preorganization and self-organization provide the basis of  spontaneous generation of functional supramolecular architectures  via self-assembly from their components. It is now accepted that  molecular recognition directed synthesis and self-assembly are  responsible for the generation and properties of biological  systems. This research aims to use molecular recognition both to  self-assemble synthetic supramolecular liquid crystalline polymers  and to direct their phase behavior. Two novel classes of polymers  will be investigated: functional supramolecular polymers which  self-assemble by using principles that resemble those of tobacco  mosaic virus, and both cyclic main-chain polymers, as well as  polymers containing liquid crystalline cyclophane (i.e., cyclic  derivatives of main-chain liquid-crystalline oligomers) receptors  as structural units. The second class of liquid-crystalline  polymers will display molecular recognition directed phase  transitions. It is expected that this research will produce  molecular devices such as self-assembled supramolecular synthetic  ion channels and various other systems which, by analogy with  natural biological systems, will combine selective recognition with  external regulation.

Bankruptcy rules affect firms in financial  distress in two ways. First, it is obvious that they affect the  outcome of the bankruptcy proceeding. Second, they establish the  alternative to an out-of-bankruptcy settlement and so affect the  nature of such settlements. The likely outcomes of both informal  bargaining and formal bankruptcy, in turn, affect the availability  of funds for investment and the types of investments equity holders  will pursue. More specifically, poorly conceived bankruptcy rules  may make it impossible for investors to earn a fair return, even  in situations where the investment is economically viable. Also,  bankruptcy rules may encourage or discourage inefficient  investments. Finally the bankruptcy regime affects the extent to  which firms are forced to liquidate assets even when the \"going  concern\" value of the assets is higher than the outstanding debt.  The purpose of the research is to guide the policy debate  surrounding bankruptcy by suggesting some features of an optimal  bankruptcy law based on these considerations.   The research method is novel in how it regards optimal bankruptcy  law as one element in the broader problem of designing optimal  financial contracts. Such contracts specify how resources are to  be allocated between investors and firms. Actual financial  contracts usually stipulate only (possibly contingent) payments to  investors. The rules governing the breach of stipulated promises  are, in fact, typically not specified in the contract explicitly.  They are generally contained in the legal system and are implicitly  a part of every contract. For example, debt contracts specify the  debtholder's investment, the specific payments to which he is  entitled, and covenants restricting the debtor's behavior.  Bankruptcy law provides a procedure to be followed if the promised  payments are not made or if the covenants are violated. In view  of this concern, security design will be examined as including both  explicit promises and the procedures to be followed in case of  breach, and optimal bankruptcy rules will be derived as part of an  overall contract design problem.",a9209317,Collaborative Research: The Design of Bankruptcy Procedures,"July 15, 1992",$102615 (Estimated),"Daniel H.

The  investigator and his colleague David Yuen extend the usual  canonical formulation of constant property simulation to include  realistic depth-dependent thermal expansivity and viscosity  thermal conductivity along with multiple internal phase  transitions and internal heat generation. The presence of a  triple point in the phase diagram and a more accurate  temperature-dependent viscosity are also incorporated into the  mathematical formulation. The investigators use the newly  developed proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and linear  stochastic estimation (LSE) techniques to compress the enormous  amount of data resulting from large-scale three-dimensional  numerical simulations. The POD and LSE techniques are also used  to characterize and understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of  the relevant coherent structures, such as hot rising thermal  plumes and cold sinking sheets. The investigators study relevant  geophysical problems such as the underlying causes of large-scale  circulation in the mantle, the relative stationarity of  upwellings from depth-dependent material properties,  gravitational instabilities caused by multiple phase transitions  and the effect of temperature dependent viscosity on the mantle  dynamics. They also conduct simulations with an imposed  time-dependent boundary condition at the bottom to account for  the cooling of the core, in order to study the thermal history by  starting at very high Rayleigh number, like 10**8, and slowly  lowering the Rayleigh number via cooling.  The investigators use modern mathematical theories and  numerical techniques to study the three-dimensional dynamics of  the Earth's interior. An important issue arising in the last  year is the possibility for gravitational instabilities to  develop in the mantle due to phase transitions. This instability  results in periodic eruption of superplumes and associated  intense volcanic activity. The collaborators are among the first  groups to model this phenomenon in three dimensions. They plan  to study this further by incorporating more realistic flow laws  and thermodynamics. There are still many aspects in this  phenomenon of gravitational instability to explore, as increasing  evidence from the correlation between past trench sites and the  cold anomalies in the lower mantle, inferred from seismic  tomography, suggests that such mantle instabilities could have  occurred in the past 100 million years. Recognition of these  instabilities may change traditional views of the role of  steady-state processes. They also investigate the nature of  coherent large-scale flow structures in the lower mantle as  revealed by seismology, and what effects these instabilities have  on the long-term thermal evolution of the Earth and Earth-like  planets. It was only a few years ago that the idea of a thermal  attractor from the collisions of plumes was introduced in  geophysics.

First, in the context of  traditional \"model-based\"imaging techniques, they propose to  incorporate the most accurate and extensive information that exists  in order to perform a joint 3-D nonlinear tomographic inversion for  the Tonga subduction zone. They will use multiple P and S phases  to determine both P and S velocities beneath the Tonga subduction  zone in an effort to constrain the maximum depth to which velocity  anomolies associated with the subducted lithosphere extend into the  mantle.

However, \"model-based\" approaches to seismic imaging do not  allow the rigorous testing of geophysical hypotheses. Statistical  techniques must be developed. The second part of the research is  directed toward developing methods which will provide them with  uncertainty information about heterogeneities imaged by nonlinear  travel time tomography. The results will allow them to make  statistically-sound inferences about Earth structure and therefore to  address more rigorously important questions regarding the fate of  subducted lithosphere: whether slabs commonly extend through the  670 km discontinuity, whether they become detached from slabs at  the surface and, ultimately, whether the upper and lower mantle are  mixed together.

Our objective will be accomplished by exploiting the  enormous variation in the way animals are built for legged  terrestrial locomotion. Energy, oxygen transport and musculo-  skeletal systems have been well studied during steady-state,  constant speed locomotion, but these systems must also function  under non-steady state, transient conditions. We propose to test  whether or not performance limits established under steady-state  exercise is conducted intermittently. We will determine the extent  to which endurance during intermittent locomotion in arthropods is  dependent on exercise period duration, pause period duration, the  ratio of exercise to pause duration, and the speed during the  exercise period. We will also test whether or not the cost of  intermittent locomotion, both per time and per distance, is more  expensive than continuous locomotion at the same average speed when  both aerobic and anaerobic sources are considered. Finally, we will  determine the physiological correlates of intermittent exercise  performance. We will both measure and model correlates of fatigue  causing agents that accumulate during exercise periods, but are  removed, reduced or cleared during the pause periods and fatigue  causing agents that accumulate during the pause periods.

Genetic analysis shows that these  proteins carry out distinct functions at different stages of  development. The E75 A protein has been localized  immunocytochemically to the chromosomal sites of many ecdysone  regulated genes, including E75. In functional studies, this  protein has been shown to be capable of negatively regulating its  own promoter. The similarity of E75 sequences to the hormone  binding domains of known receptor suggests that E75 is also a  receptor. This hypothesis is supported by evolutionary comparison  and preliminary functional analysis of the putative hormone  binding domain. No known steroid, thyroid, retinoid hormone or  insect juvenile hormone activates the E75 proteins, suggesting  that the E75 ligand is a previously unidentified hormone. In the  studies propose here, these observations will be extended to  further define the role of the different E75 proteins and the  putative E75 ligand in the regulation of gene expression and  Drosophila development.

One major theory is that  changes in either the timing or rate of growth can produce profound  changes in the appearance of an animal. The investigators propose  to mathematically model changes in the timing of growth. This will  be done using three-dimensional data from modern animals, providing  a realistic representation of how structure changes through time.  Using the mathematical models that they develop and  three-dimensional data on the structure of living forms, the  researchers will predict what that form would look like if it's  growth pattern was changed in a prescribed way.

Many  interactions occur between the two symbionts for the initiation,  development and maintenance of nodules. The broad objective of the  proposed work is to understand how leguminous plants communicate  with their bacterial partners to regulate metabolic processes  essential for symbiosis. In particular, we are elucidating the  interactive events between B. japonicum and soybean that control  heme synthesis in root nodules. Some data support the hypothesis  that the heme prosthetic group of the plant nodule protein  leghemoglobin is bacterial in origin, and work from my laboratory  indicates that formation of the bacterial heme moeity itself  requires the coordinated effort of both symbionts. Three  objectives are proposed which address the two aforesaid hypotheses.  i) Determine whether the B. japonicum heme synthesis enzyme  ferrochelatase is essential for soybean hemoglobin heme formation  using a temperature-sensitive mutant. ii) Characterize the B.  japonicum uptake mechanism of the heme precursor delta-  aminolevulinic acid (ALA), and ascertain its role in nodule heme  synthesis. Data indicate that bacterial uptake of plant-derived  ALA is a key feature of an inter-organismic heme pathway in  nodules. iii) Construct and characterize a B. japonicum mutant in  ALA dehydratase, the second step of the heme synthetic pathway, and  study the regulation of the ALA dehydratase gene.

It is proposed to  develop a new concept for fabricating hetero-  interface systems using van der Waals surfaces  of layered metal chalcogenide materials. This  will be studied experimentally by growing  different kinds of layered metal chalcogenides  on top of each other by means of molecular  beam epitaxy, a process that has been referred  to as \"van der Waals epitaxy\". Of particular  interest of this method is the ability to  fabricate atomically and electronically abrupt  hetero-interfaces without regard to their lattice  matching requirement. The epitaxial  conditions will be investigated in detail for  improving the quality of the thin films, and  the fundamental nucleation and growth of the  epitaxial layers will be investigated. Due to  the sensitivity of the layer stacking sequence  to the properties of transition metal  dichalcogenides, we will develop a technique  to determine the \"polytpism\" of the growing  thin film using Reflection High Energy  Electron Diffraction oscillations. The unique  nature of the hetero-interfaces fabricated by  this method will allow the investigation of the  fundamental aspects related to the electron  transfer between metals and semiconductors,  from which rational design of Schottky device  structure will be explored.

The structure, distribution,  and elastic properties of vortices in superconducting multilayer  materials is of fundamental importance to both their physical  characterization and to their potential for technological  applications. Vortex arrays play a role in determining the upper  and lower critical magnetic fields for multilayer superconductors.  Intrinsic and extrinsic pinning of vortices due to layering or to  defects at interfaces is likely to be of great importance for  understanding of superconducting multilayers. Similar issues, such  as the flow and creep of vortices in the presence of a transport  current and the melting of a flux lattice, currently limit the  application of high-Tc superconductors. The proposal is to study  the effects vortices have on Josephson-coupled multilayers  consisting of alternating layers of superconducting sheets and  insulating layers. Using Ginzburg-Landau theory, the properties  listed above will be studied for real materials in realistic  environments. The results are expected to be relevent to high-Tc  materials.  %%%  Superconductors are of particular interest to materials science  because they represent both a splendid example of a quantum  mechanical phase transition and a unique class of materials having  many potential applications.

The solution sought is a formal framework for the specification and analysis of realtime systems. This framework is based on the ASTRAL formal specification language and includes the ASTRAL language for writing requirements and design specifications of realtime systems, a formal proof theory for proving properties about ASTRAL specifications, and a support environment for the construction and analysis of the specifications. The tools that make up the  support environment are a syntax-directed editor, an ASTRAL to TRIO  translator, an ASTRAL specification processor, and a mechanical theorem prover. The TRIO-based model checkers, developed at the Politecnico di Milano, are being integrated into the support environment. The main theoretical issues to be investigated deal with the composability of ASTRAL specifications. The research is developing a proof theory that prescribes how the proofs of the individual state machine specifications can be combined to produce a proof of the entire system. Another composability issue to be investigated is the composition of two or more ASTRAL system specifications (i.e., a global specification and its associated collection of state machine  specifications) to derive the specification for the composite system.

The causes of  deforestation vary with local conditions, but include conversion  of forest to agriculture or pasture lands, logging, and the  expansion of human settlements. One argument for preservation of  tropical forests is that local, regional, and global climates may  be altered by the loss of forest cover. Forests act as climate  regulators, influencing the nature and pattern of temperature and  precipitation. Deforestation changes the radiation budget and  microclimate of a local area, but the magnitude and spatial  extent of the change is poorly known. It is even less clear how  precipitation regimes may be affected. Also, little research has  been conducted on the influence of tropical forests on local and  regional climates outside of the Amazon Basin, although the rate  of deforestation is greater in Mexico and Central America. This  project will examine the microclimatic, local, and regional  effects of deforestation in the Lancandon Forest of Chiapas,  Mexico. It will involve an analysis of historical climate data  for the region, a synoptic-scale analysis of the regional  climate, and a micro level study of local meteorology in forest  and cleared areas to document the effects of deforestation.

It is striking that, in contrast to ordinary  differential equations, there are simple linear partial  differential equations possessing no solution. The analysis of  this, and related basic questions, lies at the heart of this  research. The work, phrased in terms of transformed equations  known as pseudodifferential operators, seeks to obtain  information about local solvability of systems of equations.  Related work is going forward on the microlocal solvability of  first order nonlinear equations through study of the  singularities of the equations known as the analytic wave-front  set. What has been discovered so far is that the singularities  propagate exactly as in the linear case. A new line of  investigation has also begun. This considers studies of systems  of complex vector fields on a manifold. It mixes classical ideas  of differential operators with cohomology theory on the manifold  which can be used to define generalized characteristic classes.

The new point of view is to use the  phase-space approach for describing the beam  completely in both space and time, and to derive  important figures of merit for the beam from this  phase-space description. This language relates  different characteristics to each other, leading to a  few overall measurable quantities for characterizing  even a pulsed beam. It follows that a description of  the laser beams and pulses in phase-space will  provide new, more general overall information. The  experimental objective is to design and develop a  device for measuring the overall laser beam  characteristics in a new fashion by providing direct  access to phase-space characteristics, using suitable  optical transforms and digital acquisition of phase-  space information. Such a device would present more  complete information about either a pulsed or cw  laser beam. The main significance of the project is  that: it will provide a better description than  presently available for laser beams, laser pulses and  their propagation; it will generalize to beams with  lower symmetry and also to pulsed laser beams the  existing results for cw symmetric beams; and it will  provide an experimental set-up for measuring the  beam factors of merit directly in phase-space terms.",a9209081,SGER: Laser Beam-Pulse Characterization Using Phase-Space Concepts,"May 1, 1992",$23068 (Estimated),Lawrence S.

Of concern is how different types of foreign  investment interact with different segments of the decentralizing  economic system in socialist countries. The phenomenon of  Taiwanese investment in China since the mid-1980s provides an  opportunity to empirically answer both sets of questions. This  project will examine the process of manufacturing  decentralization from Taiwan to localities in Guandong and Fujian  Provinces of China, and it will assess the impacts of this  activity on employment, industrial structure, levels of  technology, living standards, and the generation of industrial  linkages in both the capital export region in Taiwan and the  capital import localities in China.

Data will come from  published statistics and personal interviews with key actors.  The research will develop a typology of firms, localities,  investment linkages, and production linkages between the import  and export regions.

The project  proposes to survey the poorly known inshore fish faunas of  selected regions in the Caribbean Basin to delimit areas of  endemism of both inshore and freshwater fishes on the Caribbean  Tectonic Plate, and to infer general patterns of area relationships  based on the interrelationships of the fishes.  The sampling program that will address the biogeographic  points above is precisely the same as that needed to develop  management plans for Caribbean fishes. In order to maximize the  project's contribution to conservation of fishes, surveys will be  directed at areas where marine biodiversity preserves are under  development, but where shorefish biodiversity has not yet been  adequately assessed.

The research focuses on two simple learning  paradigms, classical conditioning and habituation, that are  common to many species and situations. An essential idea of the  analysis is that we can make significant progress toward  understanding the nature of human reactions to complex situations  by elucidating how prior learning and current emotional state  influence behavior in simplified paradigms like these.   The immediate goal of the research is to measure the relative  contributions of prior learning and emotional responsiveness to  performance, using one of the \"model systems\" of modern  psychobiology, the eyeblink reflex system of rabbits.  Activation-elicitation theory prescribes methods for making such  measurements, which should lead to revised estimates of emotive  processes in these examples of simple learning. For example,  certain procedures thought to promote new learning may actually  be effective because they produce emotional changes as well.  Clarifying this issue has both theoretical and practical  significance. Researchers often use classical conditioning to  study the formation of simple associations, assuming that higher  levels of conditioned responding corresponds to stronger  associations or more information. A practical example of such  reasoning is to consider a drug or surgical treatment that  increases conditioned responding to be a potential aid to  learning and memory. The present approach sharply questions the  validity of such an interpretation; increased responding may only  indicate an effect of the treatment on emotional responsiveness.   The long-range goal of this research is to improve our knowledge  of simple adaptive processes.

The amount of water in the intestine is  regulated by a small protein hormone produced in the wall of that  organ. Too little water results in the release of this hormone,  stimulating the cells lining the intestine to secrete water. Too  much water results in a decrease in the release of this hormone,  reducing water secretion into the intestine. However, it is unclear  how this hormone stimulates intestinal cells to secrete water. It  is known that the hormone binds to specific protein receptors on  the surface of intestinal cells to stimulate secretion.  Interestingly, there appear to be several receptors for this  hormone with different structures and functions. These receptors  appear to activate different signalling mechanisms in the cell.  Which signalling pathway is responsible for triggering secretion  is unknown. Also, which receptors are coupled to different  signalling pathways has not been defined. Finally, the  relationships between the different structures and functions of  these receptors have not been examined. Studies outlined in this  proposal involve the purification of these different receptors from  intestinal cells. The structure and function of these isolated  receptors will be defined and compared, to establish their  relationship.

Aryl gels are glass-like substances  containing rigid-rod organic spacers inserted at regular intervals  in a silicate-like network. The materials may be considered a  hybrid of inorganic silicates and organic network polymers. Their  synthesis is achieved by hydrolytic condensation of  bis(trialkoxysilyl) aryl monomers and related derivatives using  sol-gel chemistry. The mild conditions for their preparation  coupled with the structural diversity of the organic component of  the building block provides an opportunity for\"engineering\" the  morphology of the resulting material. The proposed research will  examine the relationship between monomer or \"building block\"  structure and the morphology of the resulting material. These  materials have potential applications in a diversity of areas  including optical devices, chromatographic supports, and as  molecular sieves. In a related study, new ionomeric materials  containing hypervalent siliconates as the basic building block will  be prepared. These materials have virtually no known analogues in  nature.

Among the invertebrates, there are calcified structures  that cover or encase their bodies such as coral reefs, snail  shells, crab exoskeletons and sea urchin tests and spines. Other  invertebrates form numerous usually microscopic calcified  structures that impregnate the body called spicules or ossicles.  The octocoral or sea whip Leptogorgia virgulata is an excellent  example of an animal possessing elaborate spicules throughout its  body. Like most invertebrate calcified structures, these spicules  contain an internal organic matrix that provides a framework for  the deposition of calcium carbonate. What is unusual, however, is  our discovery that this octocoral spicule matrix contains collagen,  a protein that is critical in the formation of bones and teeth, but  is rarely associated with invertebrate calcium carbonate structure.  Furthermore, this octocoral collagen varies seasonally, being  predominant in the summer. This three-year project will explore in  depth the relationships between octocoral spicule calcification  over time will be studied using a variety of specific markers. For  example, tetracycline is a fluorescent marker and 45Ca is a  radioactive calcification. Radiolabelled proline and specific  antibody markers that we have recently developed, mark collagen  synthesis. These components can be visualized through fluorescence  and transmission electron microscopy, and measured by quantifying  the amount of label present.

In such  situations, cooperation works to the advantage of the group but  individuals are privately better off not cooperating. Experimental  evidence from games that reflect the conditions of highly  interdependent outcomes and optional participation, shows that (1)  people who intend cooperation are more willing than defectors to  enter into such situations (i.e. to \"trust\"); (2) cooperators are  relatively more successful regarding rewards from the experimental  games than the defectors, hence the term, \"cooperators' advantage;\"  and (3) neither intending cooperators nor intending defectors have  special capacity to recognize the intentions of strangers, meaning  that the cooperators' advantage comes exclusively from the  disproportionate probability of participation with other  cooperators. This suggests that players decide to participate by  a heuristic where they project their own intentions to others.  This research will further test the robustness of these results by  investigating the effects of experience on the heuristic that gives  rise to the cooperators' advantage. Competing hypotheses predict:  (1) that repeated \"sampling\" of partners from the population pool  will lead expectations to converge such that the cooperators'  advantage is eliminated; or (2) that available samples of others'  behavior are biased and provide both intending cooperators and  intending defectors with confirming evidence of their original  expectations and thus, stimulate little adjustment from experience.  These hypotheses will be tested by providing subjects with various  types of feedback about the choices of others.

The Arctic Ocean and its adjacent seas play an  important role in global warming, and it is important to understand  its dynamical behavior on many space and time scales. At several  locations during the winter, major sources of dense cold seawater  are formed and sink. Much of this water reaches great depths and  eventually spreads through the world's ocean basins. This thermo-  haline circulation is a major factor in understanding the long-term  evolution of the coupled atmosphere-ocean system. This work will  examine some aspects of this problem. Primarily, the mechanisms  whereby the motion of the dense water that is formed by intense  cooling and/or freezing is controlled by the environment in which  it is created. Among the issues of interest are: a) The origin and  dynamics of small and meso-scale eddy structures that have been  observed repeatedly by satellite (IR) images and reported by field  investigators at different Arctic locations. b) The formation of  a halocline between the upper mixed layer and the underlaying  Atlantic water, which tends to shield the ice cover from an upward  heat flux. c) The upwelling and/or downwelling processes that have  been observed in the marginal ice zones. d) Interaction between  the shelf and the basin waters.
