Dr. Debski's goal is to understand the  process whereby the neurons from the eye choose the cells in a  target structure with which to connect. In order to study the  problem of how the eye connects to the brain, Dr. Debski will use  the visual system of a amphibian model system. In this system, the  eye connects to the optic tectum, the main visual area of the  animal. There the neurons from the eye form a map of the visual  space. This brain structure is similar to the visual maps found  in mammals and primates. One of the distinct advantages of the  amphibian is that development of the visual system occurs during  a stage when it is readily accessible. Therefore the developmental  processes which lead to the formation of these maps can be studied.  Dr. Debski's study will focus on the NMDA receptor, a type of  receptor found on some neurons. This receptor is known to play as  role in determining where the optic tectum neurons from the eye  connect. She will determine whether the activity of this receptor  can be modulated by the neurotransmitters glycine, serotonin and  VIP and to what extent the latter two of these transmitters are  found in the visual system and therefore are likely to provide such  modulation in the intact animal. Dr. Debski will also determine  the degree to which the developing system changes with respect to  NMDA receptor activity and serotonin- and VIP-like immunoreactive  neurons as it matures. The results from these studies will allow  us to better understand how to modulate NMDA receptor activity as  a means to correct error in visual connectivity when they occur.***//",a9209651,The Visual System: Modulation of NMDA Receptor Activity,"August 1, 1992",$190816 (Estimated),"Christopher Platt, Ph.D.  IBN DIV OF INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY AND NEUROSCIE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","January 31, 1995 (Estimated)",Elizabeth A.

dbfs:/data-mining/nsf-abstract/original/awd_1992_05/a9205522.txt,0313000 Regional & Environmental  88 Geography,"Most geographical studies of waterways and boundaries have  emphasized the boundary function of waterways, particularly  between political entities. Few studies have addressed the  problems associated with state ownership of waterbottoms. The  important issue in determining ownership is navigability because  most states own the waterbottoms of all naturally formed  navigable waterways. In recent years, the problem of waterbottom  ownership determination has been magnified by accelerating rates  of land loss along coastal zones and channel filling within  drainage basins. In the state of Louisiana, both of these  changes are due, in part, to cultural alterations of sediment-  bearing channel flow. This research project will examine the  impact of waterway changes on ownership of waterbottoms within  south Louisiana waterways. It will test the hypothesis that the  state is losing ownership of property through accretion within  areas of extensive deposition while it is gaining property  through erosion within the coastal zone. The Atchafalaya Basin  and the Bayou Lafourche will be compared as extremes of these two  processes. Geological, historical, geographical and legal data  will be assembled in order to test the hypothesis.  This study is unique in that it addresses the ownership of a  particular type of property, the waterbottoms of inland and  coastal waterways. It blends geomorphological evidence with  legal decisions to better understand the relationship between  natural and cultural processes which modify waterway boundaries  and the legal framework for adjudicating disputes over  boundaries. It will have practical applications to boundary  determination problems elsewhere, and it will further elucidate  the problems which occur when the legal and legislative systems  lag behind the actual physical changes to boundaries.",a9205522,Doctoral Dissertation Research in Geography and Regional Science,"August 15, 1992",$8809 (Estimated),"Brian Holly  BCS DIVISION OF BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE SCI SBE DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","January 31, 1994 (Estimated)",George J.

The objective of this project is to develop  techniques to support efficient execution of fine-grained programs by  transforming their execution grain size.  Fine-grained programs present special problems because the  overhead of each grain can overwhelm the benefits of exploiting their  concurrency. The project focuses on concurrent, object-based  programs because they allow the expression of fine-grained concurrency  and couple data and program, providing important data locality  information. The program transformations increase program locality by  grouping objects. This allows small computational grains to be  merged into larger grains, increasing execution efficiency and  reducing communication requirements.  The research will examine quantitative analysis of control and  communication patterns in concurrent object-oriented programs, the  development of program analysis and transformation techniques, and  their implementation and evaluation based on a sharable intermediate  form. Quantitative analysis provides a useful point of reference and  the basis for understanding the behavior of programs.

JH levels in insects are believed  to be controlled partly by the rate of hormone degradation. A dogma  has developed that the drop in JH level required for pupation of  insects including moths and butterflies is due mainly to the JH-  specific esterase. He has preliminary evidence that JHEH is at  least as important as the esterase enzyme, if not more so. He will  characterize the enzyme in live insects and in insect extracts to  gain an understanding of its importance in controlling JH level.  He will do this by studying JH metabolism as a function of  development and by studying the rate of metabolism of different  kinds of JH. He will determine portions of the protein sequence of  the pure, isolated enzyme, and then isolate a molecular clone of  the gene encoding the enzyme in order to determine the complete  sequence of the enzyme.

However, the degree to which this  tracer can be successfully applied to these problems critically  depends on the mass-balance of the Ge-Si system and the chemical  behavior of these two elements in the oceans. It appears that the  current understanding of the Ge-Si system is incomplete since  estimates of the hydrothermal Si flux based on the Ge-Si system are  much less than fluxes estimated from other tracers or models. The  difficulty with current models of the Ge-Si system is that they do  not account for the probability that the marine geochemical cycle  for the Ge includes significant sinks other than biogenic opal. A  series of experiments will be conducted to evaluate the flux of  oceanic Ge to nonbiogenic sediment components.

The separation is carried out in a  rectangular flow chamber which is generally under 5 mm in  thickness, and approximately 2 cm in width and 20 cm in  length. At the entrance of the channel, a splitter plate  which extends lengthwise a few millimeters down the tube,  partitions the inlet region of the channel into two halves. A  carrier fluid is pumped into the chamber on one side of the  splitter, and the fluid containing the particles is introduced  on the other side. As the fluids pass the splitter edge, a  two phase adjacent Poiseuille flow is created with fluid near  the wall boundaries moving slower than fluid in the center of  the channel. As the particles are carried along the length of  the channel, a field applied in a direction perpendicular to  the flow axis forces the particles to migrate towards the  carrier stream. Gravitational and electric forces are two  examples of fields which can be used. The separation is  effected by the fact that the magnitude of the force exerted  by the field on the particles depends on a particular particle  characteristic, and if that characteristic differs between  particles then so does the magnitude of the force. Examples  of such characteristics are size which would result in a  different gravitational force and electric charge. Particles  more strongly acted upon by the applied force migrate further  into the carrier stream where they decelerate as they are  entrained by slower moving fluid. After the particles have  translated a certain distance downstream, particles which are  not acted upon as strongly by the force are more centrally  located and have moved further downstream than particles more  strongly acted upon which are nearer the boundary and have not  progressed as far downstream.   During the last two and one-half decades, the PI developed the  technique of collecting the particles by taking advantages of  the developing separation distance between the particles along  the flow direction. As the fluid leaves the channel, those  travelling near the center elute first and can be collected,  while those travelling near the boundary elute later and can  be collected separately. The PI has termed this techniques  FFF for field flow fractionation. In the development of FFF,  scale-up proved difficult and the technique could only be used  for analytical measurement since the quantities harvested were  very small. In contrast to FFF, a different technique for  harvesting the separation is to use a splitter at the  downstream end to divide the stream into two exiting streams.  One stream would contain the particles moving near the center,  while the other would contain the particles moving closer to  the channel cell boundary. The PI has termed this separation  CSF for continuous SPLITT fractionation and has been working  on CSF since 1985 (refs. 11-19 of the proposal). The research  suggested in this proposal is concerned with scaleup of the  cell, improving its performance, and examining different  separation mechanisms.",a9204086,Continuous SPLITT Fractionation,"July 15, 1992",$324462 (Estimated),CTS DIV OF CHEMICAL AND TRANSPORT SYSTEMS  ENG DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING,"December 31, 1995 (Estimated)",J.

Preliminary work was conducted at both in 1990 and excavation  indicated that in situ archaeological materials were present.  Trou Magrite is a cave which contains an extended sequence which  spans Mousterian (prior to ca. 40,000 years ago) through  following Upper Paleolithic times. A second site, Huccorgne, is  located in open air and contains a single archaeological horizon  which dates to Gravettian times ca. 23,000 years ago. This marks  an extremely cold period when glaciers extended far South in  Europe. Both sites are rich in cultural materials including well  preserved faunal material. Dr. Straus and his collaborators will  return to both in the summer of 1992 and conduct archaeological  excavations. A variety of materials will then be analyzed to  reconstruct the changing environment and human adaptation to it.   Archaeologists are extremely interested in this time period in  Europe for several reasons. First, approximately 40,000 years ago  a major transition in both culture and human physical type took  place. Neanderthal peoples who manufactured distinctive  Mousterian type stone tools disappeared from the archaeological  record. About this time the first anatomically modern humans (as  determined through skeletal remains) first appear in Europe. A  different type of culture with a new stone tool technology and  practices such as the production of art accompany this  transition. Although this change can be observed, the underlying  processes responsible for it are little understood. It is unclear  whether one group replaced another or whether in situ development  took place. Dr. Straus excavations should shed light on this  question. They should also provide additional insight into the  methods humans with a simple technology employed to cope with a  harsh and changing environment.   This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to a large number of archaeologists.

It is extensively harvested for  timber. This species is very tolerant of drought and abnormal  soils, is fire resistant, and it regenerates prolifically across  a wide range of environments. Several varieties exist, and  morphological, biochemical, and growth trials indicate that these  varieties can be further differentiated into geographic races.  Several questions remain to be addressed in light of the overall  genetic diversity of the species, its ecological history as a  recent invader of the forests of the western United States, and  its susceptibility to range extensions and contractions linked to  future climatic change. This research project will focus on  marginal, disjunct populations of ponderosa pine in eastern  California to determine levels of genetic diversity, to isolate  the abiotic factors that control their distribution, and to  document the life histories and demographies of these  populations. Ecological sampling will be used to assess  population variation and demography, and isozyme analyses of  intra- and inter-population variation will measure genetic  variation within and among populations. The approach integrates  two levels of ecological analysis to examine biogeographic  implications of climate change and geographical isolation for  populations of this long-lived, widespread species.  The distribution of genetic diversity in forest tree  populations represents the potential of that species to adapt to  and survive environmental change. Genetic diversity also  reflects the evolutionary history of a species.

CESAME will  differ in one major way from a conventional IUC in that to date  IUCs have focused upon fostering research projects conducted by  scientists and engineers working in technological areas relevant to  industry. CESAME will be concerned with fostering projects  conducted by teachers and other parties concerned with enhancing K-  12 education. By applying the IUC approach to education, CESAME  will systematically disseminate results and nurture the development  of \"teacher-mentors\". These leaders are vitally needed to spark  widespread positive changes in the country's educational system.  Another important facet of the proposed Center is the melding of  state resources with those of federal and industrial partners. The  Bay State Skills Corporation (BSSC) and the Massachusetts  Corporation for Educational Telecommunications (MCET) will be  active participants in CESAME. This mixture of state, federal and  private sector participation is critical in an area such as pre-  college education.  The Program Director recommends Northeastern University be  awarded $100,000 for the first year of this pilot Teacher  Enhancement Project.

It is proposed here to apply the  principle of solid phase regrowth (SPR) to  fabricate such contacts to p-InP. Shallow  contacts (reaction depth<100A) of mid 107n-  cm2 contact resistivity have been achieved on n-  and p-type GaAs by the SPR method. The  regrowth process begins with a low-temperature  reaction between a metal M (e.g. Pd or Ni) and  a compound semiconductor substrate, AB, to  produce an intermediate ternary MxABy phase.  A subsequent reaction at a higher temperature  between an overlayer of Si, Ge, or In and the  intermediate phase results in the decomposition  of the intermediate phase and the epitaxial  regrowth of a layer of the compound  semiconductor doped or alloyed with the  overlayer element. The nonstoichiometry of the  intermediate ternary MxABy phase (i.e. where y  is not equal to 1) will allow the doping element  to occupy the preferential sites (site selection  mechanism), thus forming a highly doped  surface regrown layer. A thin layer of doping  element (i.e. Mg, Mn, Si, or Ge) imbedded in  metal M has been used to successfully  intentionally dope the regrowth layer to reduce  the contact resistivity significantly. In this  project, the Pd- and Ni-based contact system  will be investigated since ternary compounds  such as Pd4.8InP and Ni2.7InP have been observed  between Pd, Ni and InP at low temperatures.  Overlayers of Ge, Si, In or Sb will be  investigated to drive the decomposition of the  Pd (or Ni) ternary compounds and the epitaxial  regrowth of Inp. The effects of a thin layer of  embedded acceptor element on the electrical  characteristics (i.e. Mn, Mg, or Zn) will be  carried out.

Their model is based on field studies from  northeastern Minnesota that indicate that adjacent wolf packs  form distinct territories that are separated by \"buffer zones\"  where packs rarely trespass. These buffer zones can provide a  spatial refuge for the primary prey species: white-tailed deer.  The field studies show that deer density is higher in the  inter-territorial areas (refuges) and is lower near the center of  established territories (where deer populations may be subject to  intense predation). The buffer zones may also stabilize  wolf-deer interactions by providing a reservoir of deer that can  recolonize areas of wolf territory that have suffered heavy  predation losses.  The mathematical model the investigators develop describes  the behavioral wolf-wolf and wolf-deer interactions using a  system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, and  describes the long-term ecological wolf-deer interactions using a  system of coupled nonlinear difference equations. The analysis  of the model equations will employ mathematical and numerical  techniques from areas such as perturbation theory and finite  difference numerical methods. This should lead to a detailed  quantitative understanding of wolf territorial pattern formation,  and an illustration of how territoriality influences the  distribution and abundance of deer.

This process is fundamental and shared by a wide  range of organisms, including human. In the fruit fly, this  decision is regulated by a group of genes called the neurogenic  loci whose gene products mediate intercellular communication.  Molecular studies of these loci have demonstrated that they encode  membrane, cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. The mastermind (mam)  gene, is a member of the neurogenic loci that codes for a nuclear  protein with a novel structure. It is the only member of these  loci where sequence information has not provided a clear model for  function. To understand the function of the mam gene, three  strategies will be undertaken. First, the hypothesis that mam  encodes a DNA binding regulatory protein will be tested. This will  involve biochemical assays, and the use of a new yeast selection  system that may elucidate the targets of mam regulation in the  nucleus. Secondly, a screen for a temperature-sensitive mam allele  will be made in order to inactivate the mam protein at any time  during development and observe the consequences of mam elimination  on neural development. Thirdly, genetic screens for modifiers of  mam function will be performed. These screens may produce  mutations in genes that interact with mam and also play a role in  early neural development.

The use of fiber preforms  can significantly open up the medium to high volume composite  markets due to its potential to produce cost-effective yet  structurally sound, near net shape parts. However, complex part  shapes can result in regions where the alignment of fibers is not  in the direction of maximum loading. In addition, fiber movement  can result in regions of low fiber volume fraction leading to weak  spots. Both of these variations tend to occur in areas where  stress concentrations are also a concern, resulting in failures  below projected loading capacity. The project will investigate  several methods of measuring preform deformation (e.g., tensile,  shear, and bending behavior) -- including the use of optical and  image analysis techniques, tracer fibers, and various load  configurations simulating processing conditions. It is expected  that this preliminary work will lead to a more detailed study  resulting in the quantification of the deformation response of  aligned, biaxial, and random fiber mats. By understanding the  deformation behavior of different fiber mat geometries, the  response of various preform architectures to processing conditions  can be predicted and thus optimized to fit the desired part shape.

Its scientific goal is to  determine how feeding behaviors which change adaptively with time  affect the population dynamics of species interacting in a food  web. Previous work by the P.I. have shown that, when individuals  of a species adjust their foraging behavior in relation to food  availability and the risk of predation, interactions between  species are changed greatly. This situation produces indirect  affects between species that have no direct feeding relationship,  and can completely reverse the effects of predator-prey  interactions. These previous models have assumed that time does  not affect the optimal feeding behavior directly. Time does not  have a role in almost every natural system to which these results  apply. It is therefore essential to extend the food web results  with models with time dependent foraging strategies. Behavioral  ecologists, including two mathematicians at the University of  British Columbia have done considerable work determining the nature  of time-dependent strategies when there are discrete alternative  feeding behaviors. The P. I. will collaborate in extending these  results to situations in which foraging is defined by a continuous  variable, such a percent of time spent feeding.

Although nucleolin is  thought to bind pre-ribosomal RNA, its actual function in  processing nascent ribosomal RNA into 18S, 5.8S, and 28S ribosomal  RNA remains unknown. Xenopus nucleolin consists of unique modules  with distinct functional characteristics; the amino terminal third  contains several alternating acidic and basic domains, while the  carboxyl terminal two-thirds contains four RNA-binding domains.  Xenopus oocytes will be injected with in vitro synthesized  transcripts that encode either epitope-tagged full length Xenopus  nucleolin or epitope-tagged nucleolin truncation peptides;  subsequent immunolocalization of epitope-tagged nucleolin  truncations to either the ribonucleoprotein matrices of lampbrush  chromosome loops or subregions of multiple nucleoli will strongly  indicate functional associations. Nucleolin's macromolecular  associations within an established Xenopus pre-rRNA processing  extract will be determined by immunoprecipitating nucleolin-  containing ribonucleoprotein complexes from the extract.  Associations with other nucleolar proteins or with nucleolar-  specific small nuclear RNAs will expand our understanding of  nucleolin function. Immunodepletion of nucleolin from the  processing extract will also test the functional significance of  nucleolin in the initial pre-RRNA processing reaction. These  studies, which are at the interface of cellular and molecular  biochemistry, will advance our fundamental knowledge of the  function of the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell.  %%%  In eukaryotic cells, most of the genetic material is sequestered in  the nucleus of the cell, and it is in the nucleus that the DNA is  both replicated and transcribed into RNA, which in turn is  transported out of the nucleus to function in the biosynthesis of  proteins.

While messenger  RNA sequences are scattered throughout the DNA of the nucleus, the  genes coding for ribosomal RNAs are grouped together in a  microscopically-definable structural region of the nucleus called  the nucleolus. The nucleolus contains, in addition to the  ribosomal genes, a number of nucleolar-specific proteins which are  presumed to be involved in either transcription or assembly of  ribosomal RNAs, but for which specific functions have not yet been  determined.

The mathematical models studied in this project attempt to  predict the behavior of fluids which may react chemically so as  to ignite, and fluids in which both the liquid or gaseous states  may be present simultaneously. The design and development of  computer methods for numerically solving the model equations is  greatly facilitated by a rigorous mathematical understanding of  why solutions do exist and in what sense, and how sensitive these  solutions are to the initial state of the system. The primary  goal of this project is to provide this rigorous mathematical  understanding of the mathematical models; a secondary objective  is to apply these mathematical results to the design, testing,  and analysis of computer algorithms for generating approximate  solutions.",a9201597,Mathematical Sciences: Mathematical Problems in CompressibleFluid Flow,"July 1, 1992",$53500 (Estimated),DMS DIVISION OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES  MPS DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN,"December 31, 1995 (Estimated)",David Hoff hoff@indiana.edu (Principal Investigator current),DMS,"Indiana University P O Box 1847 Bloomington, IN 474021847 812/855-0516",Award,"",Standard Grant,9201597,1266 APPLIED MATHEMATICS,"June 11, 1992"

This insight  provides the basis for understanding many kinds of behavior. For  example, understanding that a person might have a belief that is  false (e.g., believing her coat is in the closet when actually it  is on the bed), that people may be confused by misleading  appearances, and that two people viewing the same event may  interpret it in different ways all require children to realize that  mental representations do not always correspond to the actual state  of the world. This research will explore the possibility that  children first master the distinction between mental  representations and reality in the domain of pretense. Children's  ability to maintain a boundary between what is real and what is  pretend will be investigated in three experiments in which 3- and  4-year-old children will be asked to imagine a variety of objects  under different conditions. In addition, 150 children aged 3 years  6 months, four years, and four years six months will be given tasks  assessing their ability and inclination to engage in pretense and  their implicit knowledge about mental life. Children who are  particularly inclined to engage in pretense are expected to be  better able to make a clear distinction between what is imagined  and what is real and to be advanced in the development of insight  about the mind (e.g., an earlier understanding that people may have  false beliefs). Children will also be asked questions about their  fantasy lives, including the existence and characteristics of  imaginary companions. Thus, in addition to investigating how early  fantasy is related to cognitive development, this research will  provide descriptive information about a spontaneous form of  elaborate pretense that is common (65% of preschool children have  imaginary companions), but is not well understood.",a9209318,Early Fantasy and the Child's Theory of Mind,"August 15, 1992",$104051 (Estimated),"Joseph L.

Set theory provides the popular way to lay the foundations for  all of mathematics, the best known systematic attempt to do this  being Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, dating from  the early days of the 20th Century. Important foundational  questions concern the independence and the consistency of the  axioms used to establish set theory. Zermelo and Fraenkel's axioms  (ZF for short) are one of the most convenient sets of basic axioms.  However, it has been known since the work of Kurt Goedel in the  1930's that no axioms for set theory can be complete as well as  consistent. This means that no set of axioms can be powerful  enough to prove every possible proposition or else its negation,  but not both. Upon this startling theorem has been erected a rich  theory, treating possible propositions P such that either P or Not  P can be added to ZF without resulting in a contradiction. Any  such proposition P is said to be independent of ZF and can be taken  as an additional axiom of set theory. The principal technique for  finding such independent propositions is Paul J. Cohen's so-called  method of forcing and its offspring.

The theoretical project focuses  on the role of disorder on the transport and spin properties of  granular metals and conducting polymers. The work on granular  metals represents a new thrust to this ongoing project. Impurity  band and scaling arguments are proposed to explain the  experimentally observed conductivity in granular metals. It is  shown how the impurity band model for granular metals can be  applied to conducting polymer polyaniline. In addition, an  interacting electron model is used to explain the magnetic  properties of polyaniline. Studies will be conducted on  polyacetylene and the role of structural disorder on the insulator-  metal transition. Finally, a study of the crossover from two- to  one-dimensional dynamics in the polymer poly-pyrolle perchlorate  will be undertaken.  %%%  In real materials disorder manifests itself through impurities or  the misplacement of atoms or molecules in an otherwise perfect  crystal or chemical structure. This disorder can have profound  effects on the properties of materials. The understanding of  various types of disorder and its influence on materials represents  a major challenge to materials scientists.

This project will  study the coupling between the presence of biogenic brominated  aromatics and the dynamics of members of three trophic levels in a  marine sedimentary assemblage. The project utilized the production  of bromoaromatics by a worm and its contamination of the  surrounding habitat as a model system for examining the following  questions: 1. How does the presence of these compounds affect rates  of predation and disturbance? and 2. How important are bacteria in  controlling the level of sediment contamination? Based on the PI's  prior research it is known that recruitment of some species is  radically reduced in the presence of these bromoaromatics. However,  there is a lack of information on the effects of these compounds on  the major disturbance forces in the system, sediment-biting and  digging predators, and on the processes that maintain the level of  these toxic brominated phenols in the sediment.

This hormone is released from neurons  of the anterior basal forebrain which project through the ventral  hypothalamus to the median eminence and act upon the pituitary to  regulate the control of luteinizing hormone and follicle  stimulating hormones. Thus, GnRH plays a pivotal role in ovulation  and testosterone production. However, with the development of  sensitive and specific antibody techniques, it has now become clear  that GnRH neuronal network is a complex, heterogenous system,  comprising three or more discrete neuronal groups and spanning  vastly different regions of the brain. Projecting to targets within  and outside the brain, GnRH serves as both a hormone and a  neurotransmitter, and has multiple actions, on reproductive  physiology and on species-typical behaviors associated with  reproduction. Moreover, the GnRH peptides occur in at least five  different molecular forms. Dr. Muske will examine a newly  discovered population of GnRH neurons in the periventricular areas  of the diencephalon. Using state-of-the-art neuroanatomical  techniques, she will identify the targets and projections of the  periventricular GnRH neurons for each of the different molecular  forms. Dr. Muske will determine whether the periventricular GnRH  neurons constitute an unique system, with independent embryonic  origins and developmental history. Finally, she will assess the  functional role of this system in the regulation of reproductive  behavior and physiology. The results will provide new insights  into the organization, function and mechanisms of action of the  GnRH systems lying outside the endocrine hypothalamus. Moreover,  many reproductive dysfunctions in humans result from a disorder in  the GnRH system. For example, Kallman's Syndrome, a congenital  disorder characterized by sterility and anosmia, is caused by a  defect in the migration of GnRH neurons and hypogonadism,  characterized by delayed puberty and sterility, results from  GnRH deficiency.

Some insects have even been  known to inhabit areas where temperatures reach -75 degrees C.  Although researchers have been able to identify many physiological  and biochemical parameters that may contribute to survival at such  low temperatures, little is known about the underlying cellular  mechanisms for these responses and how they are regulated. One  major obstacle has been the lack of an in vitro model, i.e. where  tissues or cells from these insects are maintained in culture and  subjected to experimental manipulation. Recent research in my  laboratory has now established a system for the long-term culturing  of fat body cells derived from cold-hardy beetles shown to produce  antifreeze proteins during the winter. The proposed study uses  this system to more directly investigate the physiological and  cellular mechanisms of antifreeze protein biosynthesis and  regulation. First, it will characterize the cell types that  predominate in vitro, how they relate to intact tissues, their  degree of developmental maturation, and their ability to produce  antifreeze proteins, using very sensitive immunological and  fluorescent labeling techniques. We will then examine the cellular  means by which these proteins may be stored and then secreted,  through ultrastructural immunolocalization with electron  microscopy, and by charting transport of newly synthesized  antifreezes from cells to culture media. Concurrently, we will  examine how hormones and low temperature may directly influence  antifreeze protein production and secretion by these cells.

The persistence theorem is studied in  the context of reaction-diffusion equations and functional  differential equations.  The chemostat is a laboratory apparatus that is used  in ecology to study exploitative competition. (It is a model of  a simple lake.) It is one place where both the mathematics and  the biological experiments are tractable; all the parameters  needed for the equations of the mathematical model are measurable  in the laboratory. The basic model does not allow for the delat  between nutrient uptake by the organisms in the chemostat  and reproduction (cell division). A standard assumption in the  model is that the tank is well stirred; hence there are  differences in the amounts of nutrient present in different parts  of the tank. To study the effect of a nutrient gradient, another  device called the gradostat has been proposed by biologists. The  mathematics of that device is now fairly well understood.  Another way to induce a gradient is to allow the nutrient to  enter the tank at one point and to diffuse along with the  organisms. The notion of persistence tries to capture the  ecological idea that all components of a model ecosystem survive.  Such theorems have proved useful in the context of ordinary  differential equation models; e.g., in the analysis of the  gradostat and of a chemostat with an inhibitor. The concept has  now found its way into the mathematical literature in a general  form, in particular for an asymptotically smooth semi-dynamical  system. The aim of this project is to use the full potential of  the persistence theorem by applying it in an infinite dimensional  context, to reaction-diffusion equations and differential  equations with delays. If the assumptions about the chemostat  are changed to remove the well-stirred hypothesis and to let the  nutrient and the cells move by diffusion or convection, then a  reaction-diffusion equation or a gradostat results. Delayed  chemostat models have been studied, but no physiological  mechanism has been introduced to account for the delay. The  obvious mechanism is the cell cycle, the time between nutrient  uptake and cell division.",a9204490,Mathematical Sciences: Analysis of Mathematical Models in Ecology,"August 15, 1992",$96000 (Estimated),Michael H.

This has already yielded rich dividends in both  combinatorial and descriptive set theory. He will also continue  work connecting amenable and non-amenable group actions with set  theory. Furthermore, he will try to extend his previous solution  to the famous \"Marczewski Problem\" about Banach-Tarski paradoxes to  arbitrary non-amenable groups of homeomorphisms of Polish spaces.  This will provide an exact characterization of paradoxical  decompositions of Polish spaces using sets with the property of  Baire. He will also investigate newly discovered connections  between logic and set theory on the one hand and topological  dynamics and ergodic theory on the other.  A famous paradox of measure theory, the Banach-Tarski paradox,  shows that ordinary intuition about volumes of sets in three-  dimensional space is unreliable. In particular, if the sets are  allowed to be sufficiently bizarre, certainly not anything that can  be drawn or easily imagined, then a solid ball in 3-space can be  dissected into a finite number of sets, and these sets can be  rearranged and reassembled to form two solid balls, each congruent  to the original one. An old question that had resisted numerous  attempts was whether the sets involved in such a paradoxical  decomposition of the ball could have at least a minimal degree of  regularity known as the property of Baire. Although not easy to  draw or imagine, non-measurable sets with the property of Baire do  arise in classical analysis and so are not considered so remote  from reality as to be easy to ignore altogether.

This  investigation of small-scale solar magnetic  fields is directed towards a fundamental,  unsolved problem in solar physics, the  heating of the quiet chromosphere which takes  place mainly in magnetic flux tubes. This  investigation seeks to examine the  stability, dynamics, energy transport and  oscillations in collapsing flux tubes by means  of 1.5-D time-dependent, dynamical  calculations. The use of two-dimensional  radiative transfer, will be a significant  improvement over previous analyses. The  results of this study will help in  understanding the physics of flux tubes, the  structure of the bright chromosphere, and  long-period oscillations of the atmosphere in  flux tubes.

The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the  use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.   This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit  by Dr. Cornelia W. Fales to the Institut de Recherche et  Coordination to work with Dr. Stephen McAdams. The purpose of  this study is to explore the relationship of noise and inharmonicity  as timbral components. By noise in this context, Dr. Fales means  the presence of random frequencies at sufficient energy to make a  perceptual difference in the timbral quality of the tone they  surround. Specifically, the project will have two parts, both of  which will test the ability of noise to disguise inharmonic partials  of a complex tone. A third study is included to be undertaken if  time and resources allow, which tests the potential of noise to  induce perceptions desired by a performer.   Auditory processing has been described as occurring in two  directions at once: from the bottom up, which is called primitive  processing, and from the top down, which is called schema-based  processing. If the cognitive heuristics which regulate primitive  processing of sound are truly innate then it is in the activity of  schema-based processing that evidence may be found for the  variety of the world's music and musical behavior. It is here that  we may find evidence in support of the contention that timbral  sensitivity varies with a listener's use of timbre - in music or in  speech. The acoustic circumstances under which a tone will fuse  with the noisy components that are part of, or close to its source,  the point at which a tone immersed in noise becomes only a series  of frequencies contributing to the noise and tone - these are  questions which bear on the subject of instrumental timbre. These  questions are equally valid for the study of instrumental music in  western culture. The line between noise and tone is often  contextually established: is the high-frequency hum of the dentist's  drill noise or tone? are instrumental ideophones noisy or tonal?  As studies of the continuity illusion have shown, the very  perception of noise is often dependent on its acoustic context;  listeners have demonstrated the ability to hear unbroken speech and  nonspeech sounds right through an interfering gap of noise which  does indeed break the sequence of sounds that surround it. While  psychoacousticians have developed precise definitions to distinguish  noise from tone, the perceiver's categories are less clearly defined.

The process of forming such  associations is referred to as fear conditioning. Some of the  innocuous cues that get conditioned are in the foreground and are  closely associated with the pain or threat, whereas others are in  the background. The neural system underlying the conditioning of  fear responses to specific foreground cues, such as a tone paired  with footshock, is well understood and involve the amygdala.  However, until recently, little was known about how fear reactions  come to be coupled to background or contextual stimuli. In recent  studies Dr. LeDoux found that lesions of hippocampus or amygdala  interfered with contextual conditioning. The purpose of the  proposed studies is to use state-of-the-art anatomical,  physiological, and behavioral methods to understand how neural  interactions between amygdala and hippocampus might contribute to  contextual fear conditioning. Specifically, Dr. LeDoux will  explore the anatomical connections (afferents and efferents)  underlying the contribution of the hippocampal formation to  contextual fear conditioning.

The PI is studying the  molecular mechanism of the rho ATPase reaction using  enzymological, biochemical, and molecular biological  techniques, in order to understand its role in transcription  termination. The knowledge gained will prove useful to the  broader question of RNA-protein interactions and to the  understanding of energy-transducing ATPases. In the present  proposal, studies of rho ATPase activity are continued, and an  investigation of rho-RNA interactions is begun. RHO is thought  to use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move with respect to the  RNA chain of transcription complexes. Rho binds to this RNA  and releases it from RNA polymerase and the DNA template. The  postulated mechanism for such movement is the ATP hydrolysis-  dependent binding and release of the nascent RNA. From earlier  work on rho-ATP interactions it is predicted that RNA should  bind to rho ATP complexes much more tightly than to rho.ADP.Pi  complexes, and an experiment had been designed to test this  prediction. To test whether rho uses the energy of ATP  hydrolysis to travel with respect to RNA, Dr. Stitt and co-  workers have developed a system to measure the amount of ATP  hydrolyzed per RNA chain released. This system is being used in  a normal rho-dependent release; it will also be employed in a  system in which an insert has been made between the rho binding  site and the end of the transcript. If rho used ATP energy to  travel along RNA, it should use more ATP in the system where it  has to travel further . The sites on rho of its interaction  with RNA have only vaguely been localized; RNA crosslinking  experiments will be use to better define them. Rho shows a  requirement for RNA to activate its ATPase activity, although  the DNA policy (dC) binds as well to rho as the RNA-DNA  oligonucleotides of defined sequence will be used to identify  the locations on RNA where the 2'OH is critical for rho ATPase  activation.",a9205559,Mechanism of Transcription Termination Protein Rho,"February 15, 1992",$170000 (Estimated),Todd M.

Because these deposits contain progressive  structures and well developed unroofing sequences of clast types,  they should be useful for incremental retrodeformation of the NE  Utah thrust belt. The general questions to be addressed include:  (1) What are the structural characteristics of proximal,  thrust-derived fans, and can these structures be used to  retrodeform the conglomerates? (2) What are the spatial  relationships between angular unconformities and large-scale  morphostratigraphic lithosomes in these proximal fans, and can  these relationships shed new light on interpretations of tectonic  control on sediment distribution during thrust faulting? (3) What  structures control the production and distribution of sediment in  thrust belts--large scale structural culminations or frontal tip  anticlines? In addition to these general questions, the proposed  study will address several longstanding regional problems in the  NE Utah thrust belt, such as the location of the southern terminus  of the Crawford thrust and the former extent of the Wilard thrust  sheet.

These results will be correlated with a model of the three-  dimensional structure of v-Src based on the recent crystal  structure of the catalytic domain of the cAMP-dependent protein  kinase. Finally, to identify determinants in protein  substrates for v-Src which confer recognition by the enzyme,  synthetic peptide \"libraries\" will be used to select those  peptides which give maximal phosphorylation by v-Src. The goal  of these studies is to describe at a molecular level the steps  leading to the formation of the \"signalling complexes\" which  play a central role in signal transduction and oncogenic  transformation.  %%%  This research involves the role of certain regions of a protein  in its ability to phosphorylate tyrosine residues of other  proteins. These regions may be important for its biological  activity. These regions will be identified by chemical labelling  and genetic experiments. These results will be correlated with a  model of the three-dimensional structure of protein based on the  recent crystal structure of a similar enzyme. Lastly, special  substrates for the enzyme will be prepared by random substitution  of a variety of amino acids for the particular one found in a  peptide which the protein phosphorylates.

The research focuses on  three principal application areas: Monte Carlo simulation of  lattice spain models and field theories; solution of large linear  systems of equations with disordered coefficients; and Monte  Carlo simulation of self-avoiding random walk. The principal  algorithmic strategy is to employ \"collective-mode\" updates, such  as multi-grid, auxiliary-variable, embedding and generalizations  thereof. Some of these algorithms are motivated by techniques  used in the numerical solution of elliptic partial differential  equations, but novel adaptations are required. The methodology  involves a combination of heuristic physical reasoning, rigorous  mathematical analysis, and systematic numerical testing. One  principal project is to continue the development of the multi-  grid Monte Carlo method, with emphasis on lattice gauge theories.  A second project is to develop multi-grid algorithms for large  linear systems with disordered coefficients; examples are the  lattice fermion and Faddeev-Popov propagators in a background  gauge field.

Metal ions  dissolved in this system preferentially dissolve in the PEG  rich phase, and hence ion separation can be effected by simply  dissolving polymer and salt in a metal-containing aqueous  stream, and then separating the phases. The variables which  affect the metal partitioning are the pH, salt selection, PEG  concentration, temperature and distance from the critical  point (i.e. the polymer/salt composition at which two phases  first appear).   Several critical areas are proposed for study:  (i) In previous research, the PI has demonstrated in a series  of batch experiments, that technetium in the form of TcO4- can  be extracted into the PEG rich phase using carbonate (K2CO3)  and sulphate ((NH4)2SO4 without the need of a complexing  agent. The PI intends to study this novel result further, and  to build on this discovery by finding a method to strip the  metal ions from the PEG-rich phase and complete the separation  process. Several methods will be tested including ion  exchange, and oil-water batch extraction with the PEG as the  aqueous phase.  (ii) Optimize particular biphasic systems (SO42-,CO32-, PO43- or  alkmaline media) for the selective removal of Tc or Cr (in the  form of CrO41-).  (iii) Base-Side extraction of alkali and alkaline earth metal  ions from synthetic waste solutions of high alkalinity and  high nitrate concentration.  (iv) Biphasic systems for the removal of toxic metal cations  using inorganic anions to form extractable complex anions of  metals.

Infrastructure refers to  transportation systems, waterfront  structures, water retaining  structures such as earth dams,  underground structures, and in  general, any structure built on or  of soils. Losses in the  infrastructure due to earthquake  damage has been a significant  fraction of the initial  construction costs.   Assessment and mitigation of damage  to the infrastructure involves  identifying the potential damage to  the infrastructure caused by large  earthquakes, as well as the  research needed to reduce these  losses through improved design and  construction methods. A particular  focus is on verification of these  design and construction methods.  It is motivated by questions such  as: In the event of a magnitude 8  earthquake occurring, can an  estimate be made of the damage to  the infrastructure? Are the  current methods of analysis  adequate to evaluate the potential  damage due to a large magnitude  earthquake and to provide an  economic method for strengthening  the infrastructure? These  questions can be answered  effectively only if the procedures  used for analysis have been  verified.

However, little is known about the balance between  selection and gene flow that currently maintains the observed  genetic differentiation of aphids on the two hosts. On both hosts,  the performance of transplanted individuals is much lower than that  of residents, indicating strong disruptive selection. Pea aphids  are capable of flying between fields of the different crops and  specialist clones can interbreed and produce viable offspring, so  migration and gene flow are physically possible. How much gene  flow actually takes place? The major questions addressed in this  proposal are (1) is the host-associated divergence maintained by  selection in the face of free gene flow between crops? and (2) if,  as we expect, gene flow is restricted, by what ecological and  genetic mechanisms does this occur? First, the extent of inter-  host gene flow will be determined using both direct and indirect  methods, with measures of gene flow between fields of the same crop  as a reference point. Preliminary results suggest that populations  on the two crops are neither completely isolated nor panmictic.  Various mechanisms that could act to limit gene flow between these  divergent populations will be then evaluated, including habitat  choice by alate (winged) forms, selection against migrants,  phenological separations between mating population on the two  crops, and reduced fitness of hybrids due to developmental failure  and/or lack of adaptation to the parental environments. The  results of these experiments will provide a detailed view of the  mechanisms by which closely adjacent populations in different  habitats remain genetically differentiated despite the potential to  interbreed. This study represents a unique opportunity to study  mechanisms of local adaptation and population divergence. These  experiments will also provide a case study of gene flow restriction  that has implications for the study of speciation, and the process  by which insect pests adapt to specific crop plants.",a9207573,Extent and Mechanisms of Gene Flow Limitation between Divergent Populations,"December 15, 1992",$150000 (Estimated),Mark W.

The formation  ranges from 300 to 1350 meters and forms a westward-thickening  wedge from craton margin to shelf-edge and base-of-slope facies.  The Bonanza King is composed of >200 meter-scale carbonate cycles  that provide a remarkable strip record of Middle to Late Cambrian  third-order relative sea-level oscillations.  Preliminary results suggest that four and a half third-order  sequences can be recognized and mapped out across the Bonanza King  platform. Intervals of thick subtidal cycles appear to  characterize the transgressive systems tracts, intervals of thin  peritidal cycles characterize the highstand systems tracts and thin  zone of peritidal cycles exhibiting evidence of sporadic exposure  probably manifest sequence boundary zones. Intracyclic abundance  of early dolomite decreases systematically from craton margin to  outer platform. Cycles in sequence boundary zones and upper  highstand systems tracts are dominantly dolomite whereas cycles in  transgressive systems tracts and lower highstand systems tracts  retain abundant limestone.

Predictable  variations in cycle stacking patterns and cross-platform trends  will be used to identify the component systems tracts and bounding  unconformities. 2) Develop a reliable Middle to Late Cambrian  accommodation curve of comparison to other published curves to  determine the degree of eustatic control on sequence development.  3) Document the effects of sea-level fluctuations of all  frequencies on early diagenesis of Bonanza King carbonates. 4)  Evaluate the textural, petrophysical and geochemical changes that  occur in early diagenetic facies during fluid-rock interaction  throughout burial.

It is a basic form of memory, essential for normal  cognitive function; its absence is a sign of very severe pathology.  Recent work has shown that normal recognition memory is  characterized by strong regularities that permit the analysis of  its underlying psychological mechanisms. One such regularity is  that anything that affects performance on old items, items seen  before, such as increased study time or forgetting, also affects  performance on new items, those not seen before, in exactly the  same way. For example, if forgetting is produced by increasing the  time from presentation of old items to test, an individual performs  more poorly on the old items, as one might expect, but also  performs more poorly on new items; this is unexpected, since the  new items will never have been seen before the test and might be  expected to be unaffected by a delay preceding the test. The  symmetry of the effect indicates that the individual performs  (though almost certainly not consciously) a complex analysis of the  state of items, an analysis of the sort expected by a particular  set of decision theories, including signal detection theory.

One seeks to recover the neutron interaction  potential, which is a bounded, real valued function defined on  the real line, that is zero to the left of the origin, and  approaches a nonzero constant as the space variable tends to  positive infinity. The information to be used for the  reconstruction is the amplitude of the reflection coefficient  corresponding to a wave incoming from the left, defined in the  usual quantum mechanical sense. Because the reflection  coefficient is in general complex valued, the missing phase  information is the central difficulty, and in fact this problem  is closely related to the well known phase retrieval problem in  optics. However, even if the full complex reflection amplitude  were known, the problem still presents some new aspects, in  comparison with standard formulations of inverse scattering for  the Schrodinger equation, because of the fact that the potential  does not decay to zero. The investigator will also consider some  cases in which the phase data are partially known. In the  neutron scattering application, one may usually assume that the  potential does not have any bound states, and this hypothesis is  essential for the main line of approach. Nevertheless the case  when bound states are present is of some interest also, so an  alternative procedure allowing for this possibility will be  investigated.  A newly emerging technology for the detailed analysis of  chemical and magnetic properties of layered materials is the use  of neutron reflectivity data. For example, there are many  applications to the study of surface and interface structure at  the molecular level for polymer blends. This in turn is a  valuable tool in the development of new high performance  materials. In a typical experimental set up, a beam of neutrons  is incident from a vacuum region onto a reflecting material,  whose material properties vary only in the direction  perpendicular to the material surface. An instrument called the  neutron reflectometer measures the reflected neutron intensity  with high precision as a function of the particle's momentum in  the direction perpendicular to the surface. These data are thus  dependent in some manner on the so-called neutron interaction  potential, which is a function of location within the material.  If this potential can be determined, then other physical  properties of the material can be directly inferred. The  proposed research addresses directly the problem of interpreting  reflectivity data in order to determine the interaction  potential. Specifically, the investigator seeks to understand  the mathematical structure of the problem, and to develop  accurate and reliable computational procedures.",a9201936,Mathematical Sciences: Inverse Problems in Neutron Reflectometry,"August 1, 1992",$45000 (Estimated),Michael H.

Studies to date indicate that  Synechococcus is grazed at rates comparable to its growth rate and  that microflagellates are the major group responsible for turning  over Synechococcus biomass. Synechococcus has a characteristic  discontinuous pattern of diel growth both in nature and in culture  that can be monitored by direct and indirect methods. Results of  experiments measuring both growth and grazing rates of  Synechococcus in the Sargasso Sea led to the hypothesis that  grazing of Synechococcus by microflagellates can be periodic,  occurring primarily at night. To test this hypothesis, Dr.  Waterbury will isolate and characterize the microflagellates  responsible for Synechococcus turnover and document their impact on  the temporal patterns of Synechococcus abundance.

Major geologic  opportunities are offered by the Pliocene Hadar Formation because  of its setting along the tectonic margin between the Ethiopian  Plateau and the Afar Depression with an outstanding badlands  exposure that extends well beyond the studied site of Hadar. We  will build a facies model of deposition for the formation pegged  to a very good stratigraphic/geochronologic framework. The  previous sedimentological work stressed stratigraphic correlation  and suggested only very generalized environments of deposition.  Being just 50 km east of the presently 2.5 km high Plateau  escarpment, these Pliocene deposits remarkably consist of 70% mud  units and only 30% sands. Most of the muds are massive with  incipient arid paleosols. Minor laminated mud sequences were  deposited in a lake we hypothesize transgressed from the east  (central Afar). While the massive mud sand sequence seems to  represent deposits of a meandering river the sands are too  laterally extensive and too gradational into cobble conglomerates  (westward toward the escarpment) to be explained by presently  available meandering stream models.  By delineating and mapping detailed subfacies, especially in  the sands and by cataloging lateral and vertical sequences and the  first systematic paleocurrent data, we can assess sandflat versus  various channelized flow options. For the muds we hope to  delineate paleosols of varying maturity, and whether the lake was  saline or fresh. Careful facies mapping along the several  isochronal tuff surfaces will provide environmental mosaic  time-slices across Hadar. This research should provide: (1) a  significant segment of the history of the Afar tectonic boundary;  (2) knowledge of the environments where the hominids lived and were  preserved, and a strategy for exploring for them in the vast  exposures east and west of Hadar, and; (3) a contribution toward  a general facies model for thick rapid alluvial deposition where  sheets sands exist in association with thick muds.",a9206516,"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Sedimentology and Environment of Deposition of the Hadar Formation, Ethiopia","July 15, 1992",$82832 (Estimated),Joanne Bourgeois  EAR DIVISION OF EARTH SCIENCES  GEO DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES,"December 31, 1994 (Estimated)",Carl F.

His co-hosts will be  Mr. Toshiaki Ohashi, AI Technology Department,  Computer and Communication Research Center and  Mr. Akira Maeda, Technology Research Group,  Research and Development Planning Department.  The research will include a study of the  techniques for evaluating the impact of demand  side management (DSM) in the Japanese Electric  Utility Industry. They will be dealing with  the modeling of uncertainty related to demand  side management activities. These  uncertainties originate from the unknown  customer response to the DSM programs, and  their willingness or unwillingness to maintain  interest in the program under less than ideal  conditions. An attempt will be made to model  such uncertainty using the \"pairwise  comparison\" technique that Professor Rahman has  applied in other fields of electric power  engineering. Once such quantitative measures  of uncertainty are available, they will be  applied to a generation expansion model to  examine the impacts of DSM on capacity needs.  A new technique to model the load duration  curve will be investigated which will  facilitate the representation of DSM impacts on  peak load, load factor and energy consumption.  This will provide an analytical method to study  the impact of DSM on capacity requirements. In  the past, iterative methods have been applied  to study these impacts. An analytical method  would result in faster solutions with higher  accuracy.   The research has a comparative value and should  also provide a potential methodology with which  to evaluate DSM programs prior to their  initiation. The research may also result in  useful analytical techniques that are  fundamentally different from presently used  demand management evaluation methods.  Professor Rahman is knowledgeable in a wide-  range of topics related to power systems  engineering.

Central to the project is a steepest decent method for  analyzing the asymptotics of oscillatory Riemann-Hilbert problems  of the kind that arise in the theory of integrable nonlinear  equations. To date the method has been applied to the modified  Korteweg-deVries equation and the defocusing nonlinear  Schrodinger equation.  The steepest descent method mentioned above gives long time  asymptotics of solutions to Cauchy problems integrable by the  inverse scattering method. A great deal of work has been done  along the same lines, but much is formal and very little is  rigorous. This project will first seek to analyze the zero  dispersion limit problems for Korteweg-deVries equations, that  is, to study directly the corresponding oscillatory Riemann-  Hilbert problem. It is expected that the new method will not  require any spectral assumptions, and that, once worked out, will  apply to a broad class of problems.  A second line of research will consider Hamiltonians arising  as transverse Ising models at the critical transverse magnetic  field. The corresponding autocorrelation function can be  computed from the solution of the associated Riemann-Hilbert  problem.

The data  collected by Mr. Inomata will hopefully allow him to determine  whether the stone walls played a defensive purpose. It will also  permit him to learn how social organization at the site changed  over time and whether occupation was abruptly terminated.   Mayan peoples developed a complex centralized society in the  inhospitable tropical lowlands of Middle America. They built  temples and other ceremonial structures, developed appropriate  agricultural technologies and created societal structures which  incorporated tens of thousands of individuals into single political  units. During the late first millennium A.D. however these entities  disappeared - a phenomenon referred to as the \"Mayan Collapse.\" The  cause for this is still uncertain. While some researchers argue  that ecological change played a major role, others point to the  possible effect of warfare. Much recent interest has focussed on  the El Peten region of Guatemala where defensive walls suggest  large scale conflict. Mr. Inomata's work will provide valuable data  relevant to this question.   This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists.

One of the most dramatic examples of this  phenomenon is language. Virtually all speakers of a language learn  to speak and understand before formal instruction even begins, and  the learning process seems to be largely unaffected by attempts of  adults to guide it. This style of learning contrasts with the more  explicit learning which also occurs when people consciously attempt  to master a domain, and which typically involves explicit  formulation and testing of hypotheses. Although considerable  research has been carried out on explicit learning, implicit  learning has been investigated only recently. Furthermore, most of  this research has been experimental, with relatively little work  focussed on developing theories or computational models.   The purpose of this research is to develop both a theory and a  testable computational model of implicit learning of sequential  behaviors. The research will use experimental techniques to ask  the following questions: Under what conditions is implicit  learning triggered? Are there domains in which implicit learning  is more effective than explicit learning? What are the constraints  on the types of things which can be learned with implicit learning?  A second component of the research will focus on trying to  understand the possible mechanism for implicit learning by  developing a computational model. This model, based on an  artificial neural network architecture proposed by Elman, has been  shown to have interesting properties which resemble the behaviors  of humans engaged in implicit learning tasks.   Elaboration of this model should allow for better understanding of  the circumstances which facilitate learning of domains such as  language and might make it possible to structure training  environments in order to maximize learning. This work should also  provide a foundation for the construction of machine-based systems  for learning domains currently only well-mastered by humans.",a9209432,Implicit Learning of Sequential Inputs: Developing a Computational Model,"August 15, 1992",$169996 (Estimated),"Joseph L.

The method uses streams of highly uniform  droplets of molten metal which are deposited onto a substrate in  a controlled environment such as a vacuum or higher pressures of  selected gases. The droplet deposition rate is controlled such  that rapid solidification occurs leading to a net-formed material  with small grain size and high structural integrity. By using  novel droplet stream generation techniques the droplets are  directed onto the substrate with very small angular and speed  dispersions thereby making possible the synthesis of small detailed  parts. Since the droplets are the same size (typically 30-150  microns in diameter) and travel at the same speed, the absence of  pre-solidification droplets in the final product leads to a more  homogeneous, and thus higher quality part than is normally achieved  with other related techniques. Since the solidification rate  determines the structural integrity of the net-formed part, the  droplet deposition rate, speeds, and sizes are parameters which  will be varied in the study. The homogeneity and grain structure  of the net-formed parts will be examined both optically and with  the use of an electron microscope, and their mechanical  characteristics will be studied by subjecting formed parts to tests  in both compression and tension.  The reduction of the proposal process to practice may allow  the rapid fabrication of parts directly from computer-based  descriptions.

The planner  typically cannot prove that any alternative will or will not be  successful, and so it much choose among plans on the basis of how  likely they are to achieve their aims and how efficiently they do  so. Decision theory supplies a normative model for making these  choices, but is not directly applicable to the planning problem as  AI has posed it, and more importantly does not provide a  computational framework within which to make the choices. In  particular, decision theory offers no advice on how to generate or  modify plans. Decision theory and symbolic AI planning algorithms  therefore offer complementary strengths: the former provides a rich  representation for expressing choice among alternatives and a  theory of how to make those choices rationally; the latter provides  a computational method for generating and improving plans, but  under restrictive assumptions. The two approaches will be  integrated to produce a practical decision-theoretic planner.

Vertebrates cannot synthesize and thus  require a dietary source of linoleic acid, 18:2(n-6), which is used  both as a structural component of membranes and as a precursor for  the eicosanoids. Until recently, all animals, including insects,  were considered unable to synthesize linoleic acid. Studies in our  laboratory demonstrated that a number of insect species possess a  12 desaturase and are thus able to produce linoleic acid.  Extensive research, funded by the NSF, was performed to  unambiguously demonstrate that insect tissue, and not associated  microorganisms, contain the 12 desaturase. Studies are proposed  herein to characterize the 12 desaturase from three representative  insect species, a cockroach, a cricket and an aphid. Work will be  done to elucidate the substrate requirements and specificity for  the desaturase, to optimize activity, to determine the number and  nature of the components in the desaturase, to examine the  physiological regulation of activity, to determine the fate of the  newly synthesized linoleate and to begin work on the solubilization  and purification of the enzyme.

There is now genetic evidence  that three enzyme activities of de novo purine biosynthesis reside  on a single polypeptide chain. The protein has been isolated from  a murine lymphoma cell line in low yield and characterized as to  size, formyl group donor, trifunctionality, and kinetic mechanism  of glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GART). The studies  will now be extended to use molecular biology techniques to prepare  the human trifunctional protein in high yield from bacteria, to  prepare an expression vector to obtain only the GART domain from  bacteria and then do site-directed mutagenesis of it, and to try to  crystallize both the trifunctional protein and the GART domain to  do structural studies in the presence of substrate analogs which  are dead-end inhibitors. These carbocyclic nucleotide analogs are  being synthesized at present, and will be used to analyze the  mechanism of conversion of IMP, the product of the de novo purine  synthesis, to AMP and GMP. The activity of AMP and GMP analogs and  their 2-deoxy analogs will be used to study the mechanisms of  ribonucleotide reductase, RNA polymerase, and DNA polymerase.  %%%  Synthesis of purines de novo is very important metabolically.

We are particularly motivated by the recent  demonstration of visible light photoluminescence from porous Si,  and believe the work proposed here will give an opportunity to make  much more controlled nanocrystal structures and will present more  opportunity for electro-luminescence device structures than porous  Si if the proposed mechanism of quantum confinement in Si  nanocrystals proves to be valid. We are also motivated by recent  theoretical and experimental work showing that quantum dots of  semiconductors can have very large nonlinear optical properties.  %%%  Fundamental studies of the epitaxial growth and the optical  properties of very small crystallites (nanocrystals) will be  carried out. These nanocrystals will be fabricated with techniques  potentially compatible with silicon Very Large Scale Integration  (VLSI), and may lead to the fabrication of new opto-electronic  materials allowing monolithic fabrication of devices which utilize  VLSI digital processing and optical communication and/or processing  for faster, more efficient computing and information processing in  the future.",a9203183,Molecular Beam Epitaxial Growth of Nanocrystals for Optical Applications,"September 15, 1992",$231700 (Estimated),LaVerne D.

Curved surfaces are particularly subject to this effect.  This research concentrates on recognizing curved surfaces from  their outline in a single perspective image, using both  theoretical studies and practical implementations, along two  lines of investigation. The problem has already been solved for  generic algebraic surfaces by the Principal Investigator. The  result indicates that an image outline contains substantial  amounts of information about an object's shape. The research  will investigate extending this result to a wider range of  popular surfaces, and will also investigate the practicalities of  applying the resulting algorithms. Recent work by the PI and  colleagues suggests that there is a large range of surface models  which are intrinsically easy to recognize. These results suggest  building a surface modeller oriented specifically towards  computer vision applications, where the resulting models would be  a fortiori easy to identify from any view.

The period of thermal  stratification is a time during which the intricacies of larval cod  vertical and areal distributions may hold important implications  for survival and ultimately recruitment. This project will utilize  a new technique of otolith analyses (Sr/Ca ratios), which has  recently been developed, to hindcast the temperature histories,  and hence distributional histories (that is from the time of  hatching to capture), of individual cod larvae collected in various  hydrographic regimes in the Georges Bank area. The technique will  be advanced by employing a new technology, electron energy loss  spectroscopy, which will increase the resolution of the Sr/Ca  technique to a level capable of resolving sub-daily temperature  histories. These analyses could reveal diel vertical migrations  into or through a thermocline.   Larval cod are believed to be more closely associated with the  stratified waters on the sides of Georges Bank than the tidally  mixed waters on top of the Bank, and are transported around Georges  Bank and to the southwest with the residual circulation. The  abundances of their zooplankton prey are also more abundant on the  stratified side of the thermal front in early spring, and the  larvae are often associated with the depth of maximum prey  abundance in the thermocline. Later in the year the late larvae  and early juveniles are on the top of the Bank, where zooplankton  densities become greater than on the flanks. The exact nature of  the vertical and areal distributions of the larvae in relation to  mixed and stratified waters may be very important with regard to  horizontal transport processes, temperature effects on growth, and  the availability of zooplankton prey items. This project will  employ new technology to examine the distributions of cod larvae  and will form a collaborative link with an already-funded study  (NOAA) that focuses on the physics of the vernal stratification  process as it relates to the complete suite of zooplankton, and the  distribution, growth and condition of cod and haddock larvae, thus  making for a strong interdisciplinary program",a9205936,Distribution and Survival of Cod Larvae in Relation to Hydrography on Georges Bank,"June 15, 1992",$122973 (Estimated),OCE DIVISION OF OCEAN SCIENCES  GEO DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES,"May 31, 1995 (Estimated)",Richard L.

One primary focus will be  continuing research on the regularity of two first order  differential operators, the complex derivative d-bar which  measures the degree to which a function is holomorphic and the  associated operator restricted to manifolds or domain boundaries  called the d-bar-b operator. The study of regularity is governed  by sub-elliptic inequalities. Regularity is analyzed both  locally and globally through these inequalities, and will be  considered both in the analytic sense as well as that of infinite  differentiability. Related to regularity, and possibly one of the  strongest motivations for studying it, is the question of how  smooth the boundary values of a function remain after projection  onto the space of holomorphic functions on a domain. A concrete  expression for the projection is given by integration against the  Bergman kernel. A second thrust of this project is to understand  the boundary behavior of the Bergman kernel on various kinds of  domains, especially those of finite type. A third, somewhat more  geometric line of work concerns the regularity theory of level  surfaces, problems of crystal growth and degenerate equations.  Level surfaces of solutions of differential equations, expecially  those which analyze the level sets of viscosity solutions of heat  equations will be studied. Among the most fundamental questions  to be considered is one due to De Giorgi, which seeks the  regularity of the surfaces as a function of a parameter in the  differential equation.  Partial differential equations form the backbone of  mathematical modeling in the physical sciences. Phenomena which  involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials  and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are  expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships  between partial derivatives.

Rather, the view emerging from studies on animals observed in  complex physical and social situations is that there is a  sophisticated interplay between social contexts and hormonal  status in the production of behavioral interactions. The present  studies will further illuminate these relationships in  callitrichid primates (marmosets and tamarins). Dr. French has  previously shown that social relationships within mated pairs are  extremely important in regulating the influence of hormones on  behavior. The current studies will evaluate the effects of other  social factors in modulating hormones effects on behavior.  Specifically, Dr. French will assess whether or not responses of  tamarins to unfamiliar intruders differ as a function of the  intruding or resident female's reproductive status, will assess  whether or not reproductively suppressed subordinate females are  capable of expressing patterns of reproductive behavior when  removed from the social context that produces suppression, and  will evaluate the influence of visual access to unfamiliar pairs  on patterns of reproductive behavior across the ovarian cycle.   These studies are important in a number of ways. First, the work  is relevant to propagation of endangered species. All marmosets  and tamarins are considered threatened or endangered, and for  some species (e.g., lion tamarins) there are more individuals in  captivity than in the wild. It is highly likely that information  critical for the enhancement of the propagation of these species  in captivity will be the direct result of these studies. Hence,  this research may have a profound impact on the maintenance of  the biodiversity of tropical animals. Second,these studies will  show how complex social settings can influence (reduce or  magnify) the effects of internal physiological functions on  behavior. These findings as a whole will contribute to a more  complex and realistic view of hormones and behavior. Finally,  these studies will evaluate hormone-behavior relationships in  species of primates that have a social system with many common  features of human societies (e.g., high degree of cooperative  behavior, joint rearing of offspring, residence of older  offspring in family or social groups).",a9209528,Socioendocrinology of Behavior,"September 1, 1992",$100000 (Estimated),Fred Stollnitz  IBN DIV OF INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY AND NEUROSCIE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"February 28, 1995 (Estimated)",Jeffrey A.

Previous excavation by both Dr. Neusius and earlier investigators  has confirmed the presence of a large earthwork or surrounding  wall and rich deposits of cultural materials within. Dating of  the site is uncertain and occupation may range from between the  thirteenth century A.D. to historic times. Seven weeks of  excavation are planned. The site will first be plowed and disced  to reveal the distribution of cultural materials. An intensive  systematic surface pickup will then be conducted. The material  will be plotted and on the basis of the results two types of  excavation will be undertaken. Hand excavation will be conducted  in a midden area to recover indentifable faunal and floral  remains as well as carbon samples for radiocarbon dating.  Secondly mechanical stripping of the plow zone will be undertaken  in selected portions of the site. Features exposed will then be  excavated by hand. Fieldwork will be followed by analysis to  accomplish five goals: 1. reconstruction of site plan; 2.  analysis of representative and provenienced assemblages for  different material classes; 3. interpretation of features,  structures and activity areas; 4. documentation of occupational  history; 5. reconstruction of subsistence strategies and  seasonality.   Many archaeologists have focussed on the effects of contact  between native Americans and early colonial settlers. Through  cases of such culture contact, underlying processes of  interaction and culture change can be discerned. Particular  attention has focussed on the Northeastern United States because  in this region the Iroquois confederacy had achieved a level of  political organization rare in chiefly societies. This is also a  region with good historic documentation. However for such work  to succeed it is necessary to have good baseline information  about both precontact and early contact periods. Many earth  circles have been found in the Northeast yet their function is  unknown. Some archaeologists have argued that they surrounded  and served to protect villages while others have maintained that  they relate not to occupation sites but rather ceremonial  centers. The answer to this question is important because it  affects understanding of both population density and  social/political organization. Dr. Neusius research at the  Ripley site will address this issue.   This research is important for several reasons.

Processes within the bacterium that result  in the formation of \"transfer intermediates\" have been well studied  and have led to the hypothesis that the DNA transfer process is  similar to bacterial conjugation. The mechanism whereby the  transfer intermediates (composed of protein and DNA) exit the  bacterium and enter the plant cells is virtually uncharacterized.  The virB genes of the Ti plasmid encode proteins that are  hypothesized to form a membrane localized \"transfer apparatus\"  through which the transferred intermediates move from the bacterium  into the plant cell. In this renewal project, studies will be  undertaken to continue the genetic, molecular, and biochemical  analysis of the putative virB-encoded transfer apparatus. The  following specific aims will be pursued. First, the genetic  analysis of the virB operon will be continued, taking advantage of  a recently constructed transposon that will make possible the  construction of non-polar mutations. It should be possible to  determine which of the virB genes are required for virulence, and  to carry out extensive point mutagenesis on individual virB genes.  These mutants will be used in conjunction with biochemical and  molecular strategies to study VirB related activities. Second, the  relationship between the putative virB encoded apparatus and the  transported substrates will be characterized. Molecular genetic  approaches will be used to test the hypothesis that pJW323 produces  an intermediate in such abundance that it outcompetes the T-complex  for access to the transport pore. The specificity of the virB  encoded transfer apparatus for the various transferred molecules  will be characterized. Further, it will be determined whether  overexpression of other vir genes affects either the transfer of  PJW323 into plants or its ability to inhibit T-DNA transfer.  %%%  This work focusses on basic issues concerning DNA transfer from  Agrobacterium to plant cells. Historically, the field originated  with studies of how Agrobacterium caused Crown Gall Tumors in  tobacco plants. Today, the utilization of Agrobacterium as a  vector to transfer DNA into plant cells, and, ultimately, the  regeneration of transgenic plants from such cells, is a central  technology in both basic and applied plant science. The advantages  of the technique are that Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is  technically simple to execute and, in many plants, occurs at  remarkably high efficiency. A major problem with the technique is  that, for many agriculturally important plants, it is either highly  inefficient or hasn't been shown to transform at all. Understanding  the cell biology involved in the efficient transformation of  certain hosts may provide insight into means by which procedures  can be modified so as to transform hosts currently outside the  useful host range of Agrobacterium.

The effect  of solar ultraviolet (uv) insolation variations on the troposphere  and stratosphere will be investigated with a General Circulation  Modedl extending from the surface to 85 km. Solar uv variations  at wavelengths less than 0.3u will be input into the model in three  situations: the model control run (which has light cast tropical  winds in the lower stratosphere) and the two phases of the QBO  (strong east winds and strong west winds). The model simulations  for the control, QBO experiments and increased uv experiments will  each be run for three years, in an attempt to separate the solar  impact from the interannual variability.

The goal of these experiments is to investgate and understand the  potential impact solar cycle variations may have on the troposphere  and stratosphere. The stratosphere is most likely to be directly  affected, and the method of any potential interaction with the  troposphere will be closely examined. Possible tropospheric  impacts of interest include variations in jet stream, storm track  and the general synoptic climatology, all of which have been  reported in the literature but whose mechanism has yet to be  identified.

The cavity-and groove-type  sites were defined, the former specific for terminal non-reducing  alpha(1-6) linked glucoses plus 3 or 4 additional residues, and the  latter reacting with internal chains of up to six or seven glucoses  not including the non-reducing end. Anti-idiotypic sera and  monoclonal antibodies recognizing either groove-or cavity-type  sites have been obtained. Model-building studies show that two  cavity-type sites vary in size. The hybridoma repertoire of  anti-alpha(1-6) dextrans is being compared with E. coli expressed  Fab repertoire. The role of Vl-CDR3 and J(kappa) on antigen  binding, idiotype expression and combining sites structure of the  groove-type anti-alpha(1-6) dextrans with V(kappa)-Oxl light chain  is being studied by the generation of recombinant Fab and computer  modelling.  %%%  The research will concentrate on the following aspects of  monoclonal antibodies to .(1-->6) dextrans: a) Mapping the  structures of the combining sites by immunochemical methods and  studies of anti-.(1-->6) dextrans with cavity and groove type  antibody combining sites and their idiotypic specificities; b)  Providing quantities of the various characterized anti-.(1-->6)  dextrans to various crystallographic laboratories for  crystallization and high resolution x-ray diffraction studies. c)  Continuation of replacement studies of a cloned antibody (amino  acid residues 31 to 35) by glycines that have shown an  extraordinary effect in greatly reducing anti .(1-->6) dextran  reactivity and substantial restoration of 80% of the original anti  .(1-->6) dextran specificity by replacing glycine 32 and 33 by  tyrosine and tryptophan. d) Studying the effects of similar  substitutions in other interaction domains of the antibody.",a9208542,Immunochemical Studies on Polysaccharides,"September 1, 1992",$210000 (Estimated),Marcia Steinberg  MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"August 31, 1996 (Estimated)",Elvin A.

However, several recent studies  indicate that this apparent complexity is partly an artifact of  difficulties with the nomenclature itself. The purpose of the  research is to develop a high-resolution chronostratigraphic  framework for the Kope through Corryville Formations (Edenian-  Maysvillian) in the Cincinnati region that transcends stratigraphic  nomenclature through the use of event horizons for correlation,  including: transgressive surfaces, epiboles, earthquake-disrupted  beds, storm beds with unusual sedimentological features, and sea  level-associated stratigraphic \"spikes\" in lithologic and faunal  characteristics. A series of field localities and cores from  throughout the region will be measured and described in detail, and  faunal samples collected and analyzed, to delineate event horizons  within the study interval. Previous investigations indicate the  presence of several such horizons, and it is anticipated that our  work designed specifically for this purpose, will permit the  recognition of several more. The result will be a series of cross-  sections and maps illustrating a chronostratigraphic framework for  the sequence.

Utilizing both this environmental input and information about the  individual's internal status (e.g. nutritional, sexual maturity),  the brain sets in motion a variety of coordinated adaptive  responses that involve the neuroendocrine system. The goal of Dr.  Ball's research is to examine the neuroendocrine integration of  environmental information regulating reproduction. He has selected  a species that show dramatic changes over the course of a year in  their propensity to exhibit an endocrine response to photoperiodic  stimuli that regulate the timing of reproduction. Dr. Ball  proposes that the neuropeptide gonadotrophin-releasing hormone  (GnRH) is involved in the integration of signals. He will  determine whether GnRH changes in specific brain structures in  response to seasonal variation. Moreover, he will examine how  extra-photoperiodic stimuli and physiological conditions affect  reproductive activity as measured by plasma hormone levels, gonadal  growth as well as GnRH neurochemistry. These studies should  provide new insight into both how the central nervous system  assimilates the varied stimuli that regulate reproduction and the  nature of seasonal plasticity in the neurochemical systems involved  in mediating variation in responses to stimuli. Understanding the  brain's integration with physiological and behavioral systems can  lead to the elucidation of basic principles that underlie the  conservation and restoration of biological diversity.

Similar estimates for smaller domains or areas also are required.  Recently, considerable attention has been given to improve  procedures related to small area estimation problems. The  traditional sample survey estimators which use information from a  given small area often yield large standard errors because of small  sample size in the area. Reliable small area statistics are needed  by many federal agencies for regional planning and allocating  government resources. Among these are the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, which is interested in providing estimates of the  unemployment rate not only for the nation but also for the states  and the Census Bureau which inevitably misses people and must face  the problem of adjusting spatially for the undercounts.  The investigator spent the last academic year at the Bureau  of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau as a Senior Research  Fellow under the American Statistical Association/ National Science  Foundation Fellowship Program. The proposed research is a  continuation of his work at these agencies aimed at developing  reliable small area statistics. Attention is focussed on various  multivariate and time series models to combine information from  related sources. The plan is to develop different empirical and  hierarchical Bayes procedures.  To determine measures of accuracy of the empirical Bayes  estimators, second order approximations will be sought to the mean  squared errors of the estimators. This will require the extension  of the existing methodology to multivariate and time series  modelling and also to the situation when the prior parameters are  estimated by the method of maximum likelihood or restricted maximum  likelihood. It is anticipated that the posterior mean and the  posterior variance in a hierarchical Bayes analysis will involve  multi-dimensional integrals. Different sampling-based methods to  evaluate the integrals will be investigated. In this context the  modification and approximation of the Gibbs sampling method will  be considered.  The principal investigator has a solid research record in  small area estimation and is well equipped by experience and by his  collaborative ties with leading statisticians in the field to  conduct the proposed research.

Specifically, the development of the  central nervous system and skeletal system are both dramatically  slowed in metatherians relative to eutherians, however, the  development of the muscular system is greatly accelerated. These  results confirm hypotheses that suggest metatherians possess  specific developmental adaptations to the requirements of their  life history and suggest, somewhat surprisingly, that the  development of craniofacial systems is quite plastic. In the  current project these results will be extended in two major  directions. First, craniofacial development will be examined in  other mammalian species to ask whether the variation is limited  to characterizing the two largest mammalian groups, eutherians  and metatherians. Second, preliminary studies on the cellular  and molecular bases of the developmental patterns observed will  be initiated and the development of the nervous system will be  examined in detail.

Previous research has suggested that people strive to  form impressions of others that are uniform and consistent. It  seems that our impressions of others tend to be black or white,  and gray areas make us so uncomfortable that we work hard to  reinterpret or ignore information that is contrary to our  monochrome perception. However, when people rate the  decriptiveness of traits for themselves and other, they make  inconsistent trait attributions. The goal of this research is to  understand the paradox that coherent impressions of personality  nonetheless contain inconsistencies. These studies will  establish how the use of different kinds of inconsistent traits  is affected by familiarity and liking for the target, and by the  domain of personality being described. Inconsistencies in self-  descriptions will be compared with inconsistencies in  descriptions of others. A series of principles of coherent  impression formation will be tested for how perceivers retain  inconsistent beliefs in coherent impressions of targets'  personalities, including their own. The research will contribute  to knowledge about impression formation, test basic theories of  how social concepts are combined and examine differences between  personality descriptions of the self and others. The research  will result in a theory of impression formation that reflects the  complex reality of the way we perceive ourselves and other  people.

This project continues mathematical research  on the representation of solutions to scaling equations (scaling  functions) in terms of infinite matrix product expansions. At  the present time, the convergence of the product is dependent on  a contractivity assumption. The terms of the infinite product  are chosen from a finite set of matrices and combined in a  certain deterministic manner. That all possible finite products  appear lead to investigations into bounded semi-groups of  matrices. Work will be done investigating weaker assumptions  involving bounded semi-groups and establishing weaker  contractivity conditions on the corresponding products in terms  of the Lyapunov exponent. A second goal of this project is that  of using infinite matrix product expansions to establish iterated  function system algorithms for the construction of scaling  functions and to analyze their regularity and dimensionality.  The work will concentrate primarily in the multi-dimensional  setting where the most important applications lie.

This will be accomplished by  first controlling the chemical nature of both high and low surface  area carbon black particles to provide a range of acidic, basic,  neutral or high polar surfaces in the pores. The investigator will  then introduce a variety of reactive units onto the surface of the  carbon black to make it behave as a polymerizable macromonomer.

Most plant species are hermaphroditic with male and female function  in the same flower, but many other species, including a number of  important crop plants, have separate male and female flowers on the  same plant or consist of populations of separate male and female  plants (dioecy). Many different hypotheses have been proposed to  explain the diversity of breeding systems in plants and the  evolution of dioecy. One major argument suggests that dioecy has  evolved to avoid inbreeding depression. Inbreeding depression  occurs when closely related individuals mate and the resulting  offspring show reduced vigor and ability to reproduce. If  inbreeding depression is a factor, then one should expect to find  both high levels of inbreeding self-pollination occurring as well  as high levels of inbreeding depression in populations that are  evolving dioecy. Although there have been many theories proposed,  very little empirical data on this question is available. We are  examining the role of inbreeding depression in the evolution of  dioecy in the Hawaiian plant genus Schiedea. This group is  apparently evolving dioecy and exhibits a range of breeding systems  in very closely related species. This research is of special  urgency because many important intermediate species from the  fragile Hawaiian ecosystems are near extinction because of habitat  destruction, grazing introduced by herbivores and competition with  introduced plants. Knowledge of factors promoting changes in plant  breeding systems has many potential breeding applications to  practical problems in agriculture and forestry. Inbreeding  depression is well known to influence yield in many economically  important crop plants, such as corn. Knowledge of factors causing  dioecy may lead to greater ability to manipulate sex ratios in  plants and is of tremendous value where yield depends upon the  production of fruit or seed by the females as is the case of many  crop species. Understanding the basis of unisexaulity will also be  important in production of hybrid strains, since female individuals  are easily hybridized without the necessity of time-consuming  costly emasculation of hermaphroditic flowers.",a9207724,Inbreeding Depression and Selfing Rates in Hermaphroditic Species of Schiedea (Caryophyllaceae): A Comparison to Diclinous Species,"September 1, 1992",$240000 (Estimated),Elizabeth Lyons  DEB DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY  BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"August 31, 1997 (Estimated)",Stephen G.

The genetic circuitry controlling expression of luminescence  appears to be complex and to consist of interconnected pathways of  signal transduction which modulate transcription of operon  (luxC,D,A,B,E) encoding the luminescence enzymes. At least seven  loci controlling expression of luminescence (luxJ,K,L,M,N,O,R) have  now been identified by a variety of methods in this laboratory.  These loci are not linked to the operon encoding the luminescence  enzymes and have been cloned for further analysis.

He will analyze a  series of ceramic sherds collected from a number of Hohokan  archaeological sites located in the Lower Salt River Valley of  Arizona. These materials will be examined by electron microprobe  analysis to analyze the nature of the clay and temper material.  Previous work by Mr. Abbott has shown that Hohokam manufactured  pottery from raw materials which were available in the immediate  vicinity of production sites. It has also demonstrated that  substantial variation of both clay and sand used for temper  occurs across this region and therefore it is possible to  determine the general location in which individual ceramics were  manufactured. Given these data it is then possible to use  archaeological materials to reconstruct prehistoric Hohokam trade  patterns and, in a more indirect fashion, determine exchange  networks and spheres of social interaction.   The Hohokam are typical of many Southwestern U.S. prehistoric  groups because they developed a complex, highly organized society  which both emerged and declined well before the arrival of  Europeans in the New World. Because they lived in an arid desert  environment, the Hohokam constructed complex irrigation systems  and archaeologists have speculated that the need to distribute  water and maintain control over these systems led to the rise of  this complex society. However, it is unclear how villages  related to each other or how different sections or compounds  within single settlements interacted. Given changing settlement  patterns over time, archaeologists have also speculated on how  social organization concomitantly varied. Through an examination  of ceramic exchange, Mr. Abbott hopes to gain insight into this  process.   This research is important for several reasons.

Invariants to be studied include the homology of the  universal abelian cover, the higher homotopy groups, the homology  of the Milnor fiber, and the cohomology ring. These will be  described in terms of the underlying matroid, the oriented matroid  and its generalization to non-real arrangements, and the bounded  complex. The results will be applied to unsolved problems  concerning the matroid stratification of the Grassmannian, the  homology classification of hyperplane complements in terms of  combinatorial invariants, the combinatorial structure of free  arrangements, and the factorization properties of the Orlik-Solomon  algebra. The initial focus of this research will be on  complexified arrangements in dimension three. The main topological  tool is the 2-complex model T of the universal cover constructed by  the investigator. The structure of T is determined in a simple way  by the complex of bounded faces of the real part of the  arrangement. On the one hand, this facilitates a geometric  analysis of the second homotopy group. At the same time, this  universal cover complex yields an algebraic description of the  homology of abelian covers in terms of modules over polynomial  rings. The study of free arrangements will center on the various  notions of formality introduced by the investigator and his co-  workers.  The complement of an arrangement of hyperplanes in n-space is  just the collection of chunks into which n-space falls when cleaved  by a number of (n-1)-spaces.

A preliminary  theoretical analysis utilizing non-linear dynamics and  bifurcation theory will be extended to analysis of more  complex models. Experimentally, macroscopic thermal wave  propagation will be investigated via infrared thermography  studies on unsupported model substrates, studies on supported  model catalysts, and studies on a section of a catalytic  converter. In addition, the issue of communication between  two reactive spots (communications between individual catalyst  particles) will be similarly experimentally investigated.  Finally, a new radial catalytic converter design which is  predicted on the basis of preliminary analysis to have  particularly desirable characteristics as regards fast  ignition and thermal front propagation will be studied  further.   Evolving air pollution regulations for automobiles have the  effect of requiring that catalytic converters come up to full  effective operation with a minimal time delay subsequent to  engine startup, making the development of catalytic converters  with minimal ignition delay and rapid thermal front  propagation highly important. Accordingly, a major goal of  this program is development of an understanding of the  critical phenomena (fundamental mechanisms) which will lead to  design of more efficient fast-igniting catalytic converters  without the onerous requirement of external heating sources  (an alternative approach to \"fixing\" the cold startup  emissions problem.",a9200210,Thermal Front Propagation of Fast Igniting Catalytic Converters,"June 15, 1992",$210000 (Estimated),George P.

Quinn Brewster, Department of Mechanical and  Industrial Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-  Champaign, to Japan for a cooperative research project with  Professor Yukio Yamada at the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory  (MEL), Agency for Industrial Science and Technology, Ministry of  International Trade and Industry. The research will include a  study of the picosecond time-resolved spectroscopy of laser  plumes. A major problem associated with laser material  processing is achieving efficient coupling of laser energy into  the workplace. This coupling is governed by complicated, non-  linear mechanisms at the target and above the target surface in a  plume/plasma/shock wave generated by laser-material interaction.  Various studies have shown sharp decreases in the transmissivity  and/or thermal coupling coefficients associated with plume  formation. Characteristics of the plume are largely unknown, but  are known to depend upon incident laser flux level. This  research addresses the difficult problem of shedding more light  on the structure of, and heat transfer mechanisms in, the plume  formed above Al targets when irradiated by high power lasers.  This research supports a companion NSF-sponsored study which has  as a primary objective the development of techniques which can be  used to determine the relative importance of plume absorption,  scattering, and emission on coupling of laser energy into metal  targets.   Results of the research have the potential of optimizing and  expanding the use of lasers in materials processing.

It is proposed to examine several hypotheses related  to a plant's utilization of summer precipitation and how this  relates to the efficiency of biomass production along a gradient of  increasing summer precipitation.

It was strengthened in 1979 by transferring enforcement  authority to the EEOC, and in 1986 by eliminating mandatory  retirement (for most workers). The Age Discrimination in  Employment Act, in particular its abolition of mandatory  retirement, has been criticized by some economists as impairing the  formation of long-term incentive contracts in labor markets. In  the current accepted model, such contracts require the institution  of mandatory retirement.   This critique emphasizes the point that economists' understanding  of age discrimination and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act  hinges critically on the underlying reasons for the observed  positive relationship between age and earnings, over much of the  life cycle. The proposed research will conduct numerous empirical  tests of alternative explanations of this relationship, including:  the human capital model; the long-term incentive-contract model;  and the hypothesis that workers prefer rising wage profiles. The  research explores theoretical restrictions implied by the  alternative explanations, as well as data sets uniquely suited to  distinguishing between them.

In theory these  models are directly applicable not only to understanding large-  scale patterns of abundance but in evaluating the degree to which  habitat fragmentation/patchiness affects species of concern.  Critical factors in gauging species responses to habitat  patchiness are: i) dispersal ability relative to patch isolation  and dispersion; and ii) patch differences in social structure  that determine whether individual patches are net producers or  consumers of immigrants. Few studies, however, have examined the  importance of these factors to field populations.

The approach adopted is to suppose that information regarding cost  and market conditions is dispersed among different agents in the  organization, and that they can communicate with one another in a  restricted manner. Managers act strategically with respect to  their private information.

By looking at the differences that have  occurred between the sequences, an idea how long ago they diverged  from each other can be ascertained. When DNA sequences are  collected for a single gene in a single population, they will be  closer relatives the smaller the population size has been small.  More similar DNA sequences are expected if the population size has  been small.

Ultimately this will allow consideration of the times  back to the common ancestors of all modern humans and a formulation  of a picture of how small population sizes of the human species  were hundreds of thousands of years ago. To calculate the  quantities that are needed for these estimates, the different ways  that the DNA sequences in our sample could be related to each other  must be calculated. Computers are used to randomly sample a large  number of possible genealogies. This is a promising method of  exploring the statistical meaning of population samples of DNA  sequences.

Present  criteria for evaluating indigeneity has focused on a bulk organic  fraction derived from fossils and includes analysis of amino acid  abundances and enantiomers and comparison of the 13C and 15N  values of the fossil material to those of the modern organism.  These criteria incorporate two assumptions that 1) the bulk organic  material is homogeneous and 2) the relative abundance of amino  acids and the isotopic compositions are comparable to a modern  analog. The difficulties with these assumptions are that the bulk  material is not homogeneous but rather composed of several  different proteins and the organic matrix of fossils may be  altered. If the diagenetic product obtained from a fossil is a  consequence of differential loss or retention of specific protein  fractions then the geochemical characteristics and interpretation  of the data are entirely a function of the protein composition of  the organic matrix. Therefore, more precise and new methods are  needed to assess the effects of diagenesis and derive criteria for  indigeneity. A better understanding of changes in the organic  fraction of fossil material over time must include 1) an evaluation  of variation in the relative contributions of each of the protein  fractions over time, 2) an understanding of the alterations that  occur in the biochemical characteristics of individual protein  fractions during diagenesis and 3) new molecular level approaches,  such as evaluation of the 13C of individual amino acid enantiomers  (see Justification of explanation).

The main focus is the two quinone molecules that act  as electron acceptors to the photochemical events. The quinones  undergo one-electron reduction to the semiquinone, and double  reduction to the quinol state, which also requires uptake of  protons from the aqueous medium. The work aims to identify amino  acid residues active in the binding of both quinones, in the  stabilization of the semiquinone states, in the establishment of  the functional redox potentials of the two quinones, and in the  proton transfer pathways leading to formation of the quinol state.  The effects of specific mutations on the functional redox and acid-  base properties of the to-electron gate, in Rb. Sphaeroides, will  be investigated by kinetic and equilibrium techniques based on  optical spectroscopy and electrometric measurements.

One set of studies will  develop further Gelman's commitment to achieving a good description  of the kinds of understandings that children have when they start  their school math and science lessons. A second set of studies  will pursue the fact that these early understandings sometimes do  and sometimes do not facilitate further learning about mathematics  and science. The research will be concerned especially with the  conditions under which early knowledge acts more like a barrier to,  as opposed to a support for, further learning. To illustrate, many  elementary school children read fractions as if these kinds of  symbols are novel ways of writing whole numbers; for example when  asked to read 1/2, they say \"one and two\" or \"one plus two, that  is three\", or even \"12.\" Similarly, they will say that 1/4 is more  than 1/2 because \"four is more than two\" or 2.09 is more than 29  because 209 is more than 29. The research will investigate ways to  build understanding of why rational numbers are different from  count numbers, that is that fractions are governed by different  rules of mathematics than are the positive count numbers. There  are several reasons to look forward to these efforts. First,  understanding of fractions is related to understanding of a range  of important ideas, including division, measurement, and the notion  of equal units, and so on, just the kind of concepts one would  expect to be included in a definition of mathematical literacy.  Second, it is well known that fractions are a watershed for  students; those who do master them mathematically go on to learn  more mathematics, while those who do not have special trouble even  with algebra. Additionally, these studies will offer insight into  the more general need to understand how conceptual change can take  place.   This research's focus on the contrast between initial learnings  that lead readily to further concept acquisition and those that  take special efforts to surpass the boundaries of what is already  known will offer important insights on the kind of environments  that are needed to encourage and support a learner's advance to  scientific and mathematical literacy, a knowledge state that  reflects the ability to understand and use the relevant concepts as  well as their related symbols and terms. Already, Gelman's  progress with these research questions has led to the development  by others of a curriculum that embeds science instruction into a  High School English as a Second Language program.

The effects of park isolation n  community dynamics will depend fundamentally on the degree to  which wildlife populations are naturally linked by dispersal and    gene flow. I propose to address an issue that will affect the  future management of the large herbivores that to a great extent    are characterize and justify these protected areas: To what  extent are Africa's savanna parks already conserving naturally  isolated lineages, and by implication, dynamically independent  populations?  Since all parks and species cannot be studied, a framework for  predicting the gross population structure of a given species is   required.

These species were chosen  because they have strongly contrasting food and habitat  preferences. These savanna parks were chosen because they have   similar large mammal communities and, most important, because  their geographical attributes create an ideal setting to test the    RUH.

While the decline of some  species may be attributed to habitat destruction, a perplexing  number of declines have taken place at protected reserves on all  major continents. Although the mostly anecdotal evidence for  worldwide declines is compelling, studies providing quantitative  data on changes are required in order to understand and mitigate  the source or sources of biological trauma responsible for the  declines.  The present project undertakes such a study for Lower Central  America (Panama and Costa Rica), where spectacular declines among  amphibian populations were among the first to be recognized. The  study will involve: resampling previously investigated sites  following the original sampling protocols; establishing a series of  attitudinal transects in areas of obvious declines and where  declines are not evident for future repeated sampling; and sampling  individual species believed to be particularly sensitive to  environmental deterioration. Data obtained from the sampling  program will demonstrate the extent of decline, whether the entire  amphibian association or only a subset is affected and whether an  apparent difference between upland localities (marked decline in  many species) and lowland (no clear declines overall) sites is  real.

The  lithium or sodium salt of the sulfonic acid substituted polyamide,  PPTS, form dilute aqueous gels which are birefringent and exhibit  morphologies characteristic of nematic liquid crystalline  structures. The order-disorder transition in these rigid  polyelectrolyte gels will be studied by monitoring the evolution of  the aggregated structures by light-scattering measurements and by  microscopy using digital image analysis. These investigations will  be supplemented by NMR experiments to detect changes in the  relaxation rates of the polymer as the solution is cooled (or the  gel is Heated) through the transition region. The enthalpy change  associated with the transition will also be determined.   The response of the rigid polyelectrolyte gels to electric  stimulation is the second topic of this study, because the  mechanochemical and chemical valve actions produced by electric  stimulus find analogies in biological responses. It is also  planned to study the miscibility of PPTS or its salts with flexible  polymers. Poly(oxyethylene) PEO is a particularly interesting  candidate because the Li-PPTS/PEO/LiClO4 system shows sufficiently  high ion conductivity to warrant a systematic study. PPTA grafted  at the N-position with oligo (oxyethylene) will be blended with  PEO, poly(methyl methacrylate) or poly(acrylic acid).

This phenomenon may lead to increases in the  mean global temperature as well as in yearly, and even daily,  variations in temperature. One consequence of increasing variation  in temperatures if that plants may be exposed to sudden and severe  increases in temperature (i.e, heat shocks) at a greater frequency  than they are now. The ability of plants to withstand these  hyperthermic episodes is most likely related, at least in part, to  their capacity for elevating levels of certain heat shock proteins  (hsps). A great deal of information regarding the molecular  biology of these proteins in plants exist. Yet, little is known  how the physiological state of the cell or whole-plant prior to the  imposition of heat stress affect the synthesis and accumulation of  hsps or the ability of plants to survive heat stress. This void in  understanding is particularly critical because plants in natural  environmental of plants may not only be characterized by changes in  temperature patterns, but will almost certainly contain extremely  high levels of air pollutants (e.g., CO2, ozone) and changing  nutrient contents in precipitation and soils. Thus, understanding  the role that plant physiological status may play in governing the  heat shock response may provide new essential data on the roles of  heat shock proteins in the acquisition and maintenance of  thermotolerance in plant tissues. The overall goal of this  research is to assess the relationship between the synthesis and  accumulation of heat shock proteins at the cellular level and the  overall stress responses of whole-plants and tissues grown under  distinctly different physiological environments. Specific  genotypes of corn (Zea mays) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum)  will be grown in environments with different availabilities of  carbon (CO2) and nitrogen resulting in plants at different  physiological states. These plants will then be exposed to heat  stress or to control conditions. The kinetics of heat shock  protein synthesis and the patterns of recovery of normal protein  synthesis (molecular level); the capacity of plants to harvest  light and CO2 for photosynthesis (tissue level); and overall plant  performance (whole-plant level), will be examined simultaneously.  The results should help to clarify the biological role of hsps by  linking molecular phenomena to processes occurring at tissue and  whole-plant levels. Furthermore, how plants in both agricultural  and natural systems will respond to the predicted changes in the  global climate is a critical question, and understanding how the  stress response of plants might be altered in a high CO2  environment would be an important step in solving that problem.",a9207203,Responses of Plants to Acute and Chronic Heat Stress in a High-CO2 Environment: Linking Molecular Biology with Physiological Ecology,"September 15, 1992",$195000 (Estimated),Elvira Doman  IBN DIV OF INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY AND NEUROSCIE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"August 31, 1996 (Estimated)",James S.

TTQ is biosynthesized by in situ transformation of 2  tryptophyl residues in the small subunit of MADH. MADH from  bacterium W3A1 (MADHw) has unusual spectral properties. The UV-  visible spectrum is very sensitive to the presence of the  monovalent cations Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+, NH4+, (CH3)3NH+ and (CH3)4N+.  NH4+ interacts with MADH in a biphasic manner, the binding of which  can serve as a model for the enzyme's initial interaction with the  substrate, CH3NH3+.  Research aims are: 1. Study the cation interactions in more detail  by UV-visivle and resonance Raman spectroscopy, and by steady-state  kinetic analysis. 2. Begin work on the comparison of the basic  properties of MADHw and MADH from Methylobacterium extorquen sp.  AM1 (MADHA) to establish the similarities/differences for 2 major  subclasses of this enzyme. 3. Initiate steady-state kinetic  studies of the interaction of MADHW and its physiological electron  acceptors. 4. Attempt to obtain the x-ray structure of MADHA. 5.  Endeavor to obtain the structures of the enzyme an isoform in  complex with their physiological electron acceptors. 6. Using the  MADH structures, chose amino acids for site-specific mutation. The  mutants will be used to elucidate the mechanism of substrate  oxidation, electron transfer, cation binding, enviromental  interactions, etc. 7. Conduct some experiments that should shed  light on the mechanism of biosynthesis of the cofactor in MADH.  %%%  The enzyme methylamine dehydrogenase is isolated from numerous soil  bacterial classified as methylotrophs. The enzyme converts  methylamine (CH3NH2 to formaldehyde and ammonia, and the organism  uses these as the only carbon and nitrogen source for growth. In  order to carry out the conversion of methylamine, the enzyme  contains an essential factor (the coenzyme) that is formed by  modification and crosslinking of two specific amino acids units  (tryptophans) in the enzyme. The absorption of visible light  (i.e., the color) of the enzyme-bound coenzyme is changed on  addition of any of several positively charged ions. Among these  are the ions of lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium,  ammonia and trimethylamine ?<CH3)3N!. Studying this phenomenon in  more detail will provide essential information regarding how the  enzyme is able to convert methylamine to formaldehyde and ammonia.  Research aims are: 1. Study the ion interactions in more detail by  several spectroscopic method, and investigate how the ions affect  the rate at which the enzyme converts methylamine. 2. Begin work  on the comparison of the basic properties of two, somewhat  different forms of methylamine dehydrogenase from different  bacteria. 3. Initiate studies of the interaction of methylamine  dehydrogenase with other proteins that are required for the  conversion of methylamine. 4. Obtain and refine the 3-demensional  structure of two forms of methylamine dehydrogenase, and the  structures of these when bound to other proteins. 5. Using these  structures, chose amino acids for site-specific mutation (i.e., the  selective substitution of specific amino acid in the protein by  another amino acid). The mutant forms will be used to elucidate  how the enzyme functions on a molecular level. 6.

A  similar situation occurs when PEG and salt are mixed together.  Proteins or enzymes added to either of the resulting two phase  mixtures will tend to partition unequally between the two  phases, thus allowing for the extraction of a particular  protein.   Over the past three years, in collaboration with Professor  Kula of the Institute for Enzymetechnology in Julich, West  Germany, and under the auspices of an NSF grant (CBT-872084),  the PI has been developing a statistical mechanical theory for  aqueous two phase partitioning, and has been undertaking  complementary experiments on the phase behavior of the PEG/Dx  system. The experimentation involved the careful assemblage  of phase equilibria diagrams, and the identification of the  interfacial tension between the two phases as a sensitive  indicator of composition. Theoretically, simple models of  polymer-polymer, polymer-protein, ion-ion, protein-protein,  protein-ion and polymer-ion interactions have been developed  which can be used to calculate potentials of mean force in  water. The proposed research suggests additional theoretical  work along the same lines. The mean force potentials which  have been developed are to be used to obtain the radial  distribution function via the closure postulation of the  integral equation technique. From the radial distribution  function, thermodynamic properties can be obtained, and phase  separations behavior identified. These calculations will be  supplemented by Gibbs Monte-Carlo computer simulations of the  phase equilibria. These simulations will allow verification  of the equilibria obtained by the integral equation route, and  will provide a method for obtaining phase equilibria for which  the integral equation approach proves inadequate.

It is no exaggeration to say that these  studies have revolutionized our understanding of voting in House  contests, and have energized the analysis of the House of  Representatives as an institution as well. But in the meantime,  our understanding of Senate elections languished. How voters  choose their Senators, how and how well Senators represent the  interest of their constitutents, what kinds of campaigns Senators  and their opponents wage: on such basic questions as these, we had  little to say. The problem was not that Senate elections are  theoretically innocuous; the study of Senate elections provides an  excellent and in some respects optimal entree to fundamental  questions for American democratic politics. Nor was it a case of  indifference on the part of the research community: there was in  fact considerable and growing interest in the study of Senate  elections. The problem, rather, was the absence of suitable data.  The important theoretical and substantive questions occasioned by  Senate elections could not be resolved with the evidence at hand.  With this problem in mind, and with the support of the National  Science Foundation, the Principal Investigators and the NES Board  of Overseers initiated in 1988 and 1990 the first two parts of a  three-part study of Senate elections. The current project supports  completing the Senate election study in 1992. The justification  for completing the study rests on the substantive and theoretical  advances that the 1992 study makes possible, for four themes  especially: (1) political representation, of interest not least  because contrary to original intentions, the contemporary Senate  appears to be more responsive to popular sentiment than the House;  (2) divided government, now the norm in the American system of  separated powers, one that may menace coherent legislation and  erode political accountability; (3) the nature and consequences of  political campaigns, motivated by the recognition that Senate  elections provide an opportunity to examine the interplay among  candidates, the political institutions governing elections, and  voters in a particularly powerful way; and (4) the \"simple act of  voting,\" developing and testing comparative theories of voter  choice.  Provisional analysis of the first two phases of the NES Senate  election Study suggest that the complete study proposed here will  trigger the same kind of explosion of research that the 1978  National Election Study set off for our understanding of the House.  Indeed, the gains are likely to be greater here. The Senate  Election study builds upon research on House and Presidential  elections, and is carefully coordinated, theoretically and  operationally, with ongoing NES studies.

Conscience assures that we adhere to  standards of conduct and restrain antisocial impulses even in the  absence of surveillance. In the second year of life, parents  begin to lay foundations for children's conscience by setting and  enforcing standards of desired behavior. Different child rearing  patterns have been associated with varying outcomes in children's  conscience development. However, children's individual  temperamental characteristics, such as vulnerability to anxiety  and fearfulness, and impulsivity and inhibitory control may  affect their ability to experience guilt and remorse and the  capacity to suppress forbidden impulses. Thus, they may be  strongly related to aspects of conscience development, and they  may also moderate the effects of parental socialization.  Nevertheless, individual differences have been almost entirely  neglected in the developmental research on conscience. This  short term cross-sectional/follow-up study will examine maternal  socialization and child temperament as contributors to the early  formation of conscience at two points critical for its  development; at Time 1, at 29.40 months (recently proposed as the  period of the emergence of the \"moral self\") and at Time 2, at  45-55 months (on the verge of the transition to broad social  systems, when internal standards of conduct take on a particular  developmental significance). Specifically, mothers' disciplinary  styles, children's fearfulness/anxiety and impulsivity/inhibitory  control, and apsects of children's conscience development will be  measured at both times of assessment with a rich combination of  methods; naturalistic behavioral observations in multiple  context, standardized laboratory procedures, parental reports,  and semi-projective measures.

The proposed research will test the hypothesis that  bluegill populations link dynamics of littoral and limnetic  habitats via their stage-structured habitat use and thus provide  a central focus about which the rest of the fish community is  organized. The research will examine processes responsible for  among-lake variation in the production of large Daphnia, the  primary resource of adult bluegill and the factor that explains  among-lake variation in bluegill density and growth. Competition  between juvenile bluegill and a suite of littoral fish species,  including largemouth bass, will be examined using a combination  of comparative lake surveys and experimental tests.

By chemical examination and biological experimentation that isolate  the processes of food detection and digestion this project will  attempt to generalize the approach used to create a pair of those  exceptions. This project will be guided by theory that predicts  maximization of net absorption rate as material transits the gut of  an organism. The focus of the project is on three specific  processes that modulate processes leading to this maximization,  namely smell, taste and absorption across the gut wall. Smell and  taste will be determined with chemical, operational definitions  based on response to diffused or contacted compounds. The efficacy  of compounds that elicit feeding responses in the laboratory will  be tested for their roles as attractants in the field. While the  correlation between sensing ability and nutritional value will not  be perfect, the imperfection affects the ability of these animals  to sense the presence of food and so itself is of interest. The  concept of optimal gut retention times of ingested food focuses  attention on a kinetic definition of food quality, whose  determination will also likely result in identification of usable  food resources.

Amino acids  per se are the building blocks of proteins, and enzymes (which are  nearly all proteins) are amazingly effective biocatalysts. The  amino acid sequence of enzymes (proteins) specifies conformation;  catalytic function arises from conformation which, in turn, relates  to the binding of substrate molecules in precise orientation and to  the stabilization of transition states. Multiple techniques can  now be used to explore the molecular basis for specific enzymic  function and to modify enzymes in specific ways. The objective of  the proposed of the proposed research is to study  structure/function interrelationships of 2-key enzymes involved in  L-Threonine metabolism. L-Threonine dehydrogenase and 2-amino-3-  ketobutyrate lyase, enzymes we first succeeded in purifying to  homogeneity, will be the objects of in depth structure\\function  studies. This dehydrogenase and lyase, in sequences, are the first  two enzymes in the primary route for threonine utilization by both  eukaryotes and prokaryotes. By the action of these two enzymes, L-  threonine is first oxidized to the unstable intermediate, 2-amino-  3-ketobutyrate, which in turn is cleaved by the lyase in a coenzyme  A-dependent reaction yielding acetyl CoA plus glycine. Threonine  dehydrogenase is one of a number of gene products whose level has  been shown to be regulated by leucine-i.e. it is a member of the  so-called leucine regulon. We proposed studying these two pure  enzymes, with primary emphasis on the dehydrogenase and secondary  emphasis on the lyase, but selective chemical  modification/inactivation experiments, by isolating and sequencing  peptides containing these modified residues, and thereby establish  their position in the primary structure of the molecule. Since the  genes for both of these enzymes have recently been cloned and the  primary structure of each enzyme is now known, site-directed  mutagenesis of specific amino acid residues will be carried out and  the effects of such changes on the enzyme's catalytic/regulatory  properties examined. Attempts will also be made to crystallize  this dehydrogenase (primary effort) and lyase (secondary) for  subsequent 3-dimensional structure determination by X-ray  crystallographic techniques. The goal are to relate specific  enzyme catalysis/regulation with protein structure and to  understand enzymic processes in sufficient detail so that, long  range, modern metabolic and protein engineering is possible.  %%%  Advances made by studies such as this are significant in that a  thorough knowledge of metabolic/enzymic processes allows for modern  metabolic/protein engineering.

Biophysical  studies will be performed on a simple cellular system in order to  determine the unitary pd conductance. Such measurements are  essential for a further sub-structural analysis of the pd, as well  as to provide a rigorous foundation for detailed studies on the  cellular controls that orchestrate cell-to-cell size exclusion  limits. Physiological studies on the role of pd in solute fluxes  will also be performed. Since pd are likely to be an important  determinant of organ development, an experimental system will be  established that will permit identification of the processes that  control secondary pd formation. In this ongoing collaboration  (between Beachy and Dr. William Lucas of the University of  California, Davis), it has been established that transgenic tobacco  plants in which the 30 kDa movement protein (MP) of TMV is  expressed have pd whose size exclusion limits are up-regulated to  sizes in excess of 9.4 kDa. The mode by which the 30 kDa TMV-MP  effects this change will be further explored. It is hypothesized  that this protein interacts directly with the plasmodesma. Based  on this concept, biochemical isolation and purification of pd  proteins are proposed. A genetic system in Arabidopsis will be  developed to permit the identification and isolation of genes  involved in virus movement and pd function.  %%%  Plasmodesmata are microscopic channels between individual plant  cells. Intercellular communication by passage of molecules through  these channels is critical for the normal development and  physiological function of the entire plant.

Passage of the virus through  plasmodesmata is facilitated by a virally encoded protein which  effectively enlarges the plasmodesmatal channel. This research  will take advantage of the viral protein to identify and study the  components of the plant plasmodesmata.

This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit  by Dr. John M. Zielinski of Pennsylvania State University to work  with Professor Doctor Hans Sillescu at the Institut fur  Physikalische Chemie der Universitat Mainz.   Knowledge of the diffusion rate is essential in designing adequate  products for numerous applications including: (1) devolatilization,  (2) medicinal time-controlled release, (3) drying of paints and  coatings, (4) packaging or barrier membranes and (5) separation  processes. Despite the importance of polymer/solvent diffusion  coefficients, however, proportionately little data of this type are  available in the literature, particularly at varying solvent  concentrations. Due to the escalating emphasis on reducing  emissions from commercial processes, diffusion studies of  penetrant molecules in polymer systems at this time are warranted  if not essential.   Mutual-diffusion processes are inherently coupled to polymer and  solvent self-diffusion and their thermodynamic interaction. The  Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR) technique and holographic grating have previously been  employed to measure solvent self-diffusion coefficients. Only  recently, however, have advances in instrumentation rendered these  techniques viable for addressing polymer self-diffusion as well.   Although acquiring data directly is extremely important,  complementary theoretical studies are also required so that  diffusional characteristics for polymer/solvent systems can be  predicted a priori. The coupling of the self-and mutual coefficients  is the weakest link in existing diffusion theories. Consequently, an  indepth experimental and theoretical study of the relationship  between the individual self-diffusion coefficients and the  polymer/solvent mutual-diffusion coefficient is proposed.

Estimates of zooplankton production are critical in understanding  how short and long term variations in primary production affect  these rates of carbon transfer. Drs. Landry, Huntley and Lopez  have hypothesized that copepod growth is predictable with  first-orderprecision from habitat temperature alone. If this  relationship proves to be robust, we will have a powerful tool for  estimating zooplankton production. However, the apparent  simplicity of this relation raises major issues about plankton  dynamics since it denies the usual assumption that zooplankton are  food-limited. These investigators from the Universities of  California and Hawaii will investigate the thesis that, at the  population level, food limitation of copepods operates mainly  through changes in mortality rate. They suggest that there is  strong evidence for this in fish populations where density  dependence operates on the mortality of the early life stages.  Thus, the general solution of the Malthusian dilemma for marine  populations is to die young rather than starve later. They will  address these key questions in the following ways:  - (1) Direct measurements of the generation times of a variety  of warm-water copepod species, to fill a critical gap in the  database;  - (2) Experimental testing of the hypothesis that size-specific  predation pressure can compensate for the effects of food-limited  growth rate by increasing apparent development rate at the  population level.",a9205935,The Limits to Copepod Growth: Resolving the Malthusian Dilemma,"June 1, 1992",$90042 (Estimated),OCE DIVISION OF OCEAN SCIENCES  GEO DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES,"May 31, 1995 (Estimated)",Michael R.

Two distinct  behavioral properties are implied in the classical paradigm. The  first is the property of probabilistic sophistication, i.e., acts  are evaluated solely on the basis of their implied subjective  probability distributions to an individual over outcomes. The  second property, expected utility maximization, maintains that  these implied probability distributions over outcomes are ranked  by means of a von Neumann-Morganstern utility function and concerns  only the individual's attitudes toward risk.   This research looks at individuals who are not probabilistically  sophisticated in that their choice behavior is neither derived from  nor observationally consistent with the existence of an underlying  subjective probability distribution over uncertain events. Two  distinct but compatible analytical approaches to this problem are  studied. The first characterizes probabilistic sophistication in  the absence of the expected utility hypothesis. The second  develops the notions of a local probability distribution and local  risk preferences and examines the extent to which these concepts  can be used to characterize the global properties of non-  probabilistically sophisticated preferences.

In the dilute region of the  phase diagram, phospholipids and surfactants undergo a vesicle-  micelle transition with increasing fraction of surfactant. Two  types of micelle were observed recently, a cylindrical mixed  micelle and small mixed micelles at higher surfactant levels. The  phase behavior of phospholipids with surfactants at high water  content will be examined to elucidate the process of structural  transition in these mixed systems from a thermodynamic and kinetic  perspective. The structures will be identified and the positions  of the phase boundaries determined as a function of amphiphile  chemistry and thermodynamic parameters (temperature, pressure).  cylindrical mixed micelles and their formation from small mixed  micelles or vesicles will be characterized by separation  techniques, fluorescence probes sensitive to the differences  between these structures, nuclear magnetic resonance, and the  kinetics of the transition. Molecular packing models will be  tested and the energetics of assembly will be calculated in order  to improve the quantitative models to be applied when using  amphiphiles to create, for example, biological model membranes,  drug delivery systems, and protein crystals.  %%%  The focus of this study is a class of molecules called amphiphiles.  The amphiphiles have two parts, an oily, nonpolar or hydrophobic  end, and a polar, hydrophilic end. A special class of amphiphiles  is the phospholipids which along with amphiphilic proteins make up  the membranes that surround the biological unit of the cell. When  amphiphiles are added to water, they self-assemble into clusters of  molecules with the polar hydrophilic groups facing the water and  the nonpolar hydrophobic groups clustered together in the center.

Rountree and Sakurai will  utilize Rountree's expertise in molecular  endocrinology to investigate ketoreductase and  its role in regulating insect physiology and  development.   Insects are encased by a chitinous exoskeleton  which is shed or molted when the insects grow.  This molting process is controlled by a family  of steroid hormones known as ecdysteroids.  Synthesis of these ecdysteroids in the insect's  prothoracic glands is triggered by the release  of a prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH),  ecdysone, from the insect's brain. Recently  another ecdysteroid, 3-dehydro-ecdysone, was  discovered to be the PTTH secreted by some  insects. This PTTH is reduced to ecdysone by  an enzyme, ketoreductase. Dr. Sakurai is  currently the world's premier investigator of  ketoreductase and Dr. Rountree's experience  with molecular and endocrine techniques will  facilitate the study of ketoreductase at the  molecular and genetic level, providing  information on the enzyme's vital regulatory  role in insect development.",a9201505,Japan JSPS Program: Isolation of Genetic Markers for Insect3B-forming-3-Ketoreductase,"August 1, 1992",$8575 (Estimated),"Alexander DeAngelis  INT Office of Internatl Science &Engineering SBE DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","October 31, 1994 (Estimated)",Dorothy B.

Understanding of this phenomenon is a  challenging problem because it is necessary to understand both  complex dynamic and microphysical processes at scales of motion  that are smaller than typically measured by conventional weather  networks. This scale of motion is termed storm-scale or mesoscale  by meteorologists.   The National Science Council of Taiwan established a Multiple  Hazards Mitigation Project whose meteorological component focused  on improving flash flood predictions. A major field project,  entitled the Taiwan Area Mesoscale Experiement (TAMEX), was held in  the Spring of 1987. The project was a joint effort of various  Taiwanese agencies with participation from the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration and the National Science Foundation  (NSF).

Hundreds  of genes for potential zinc finger proteins have been  identified in the genomes of eukaryotes. Yet the function of  only a tiny fraction of these is known or can be predicted. To  learn more about the recognition of RNA by zinc finger proteins  Xenopus TFIIIA and p43 will be altered by recombinant means.  These proteins have a similar organization of nine zinc  fingers, yet TFIIIA binds specifically to RNA and DNA, whereas  p43 binds only to RNA. Mutant zinc finger proteins will be  constructed in which amino acids or groups of amino aids from  DNA-binding zinc fingers will be replaced with amino acids from  the corresponding position in RNA-bindings zinc fingers and  their affinity for RNA and DNA will be compared. As a  preliminary to designing sequence-specific RNA-binding  proteins, mutant proteins will be synthesized in which the  order of zinc fingers has been changed. To identify the RNA  substrates of these mutants, oligonucleotides containing a  random sequence will be transcribed to produced a population of  RNA substrates. RNA molecules that bind to the mutant proteins  will be selected, amplified and sequenced.  %%%  Many essential cellular functions are controlled through proteins  that bind to RNA or DNA. One class of these proteins contains a  protein structure call a 'zinc finger' -- a loop of amino acids  shaped into a finger-like structure by the coordination of a zinc  atom. Zinc fingers mediate protein binding to DNA and RNA.  However, the molecular features that allow some zinc fingers to  distinguish RNA and others DNA are unknown. This research seeks to  understand the molecular basis for selectivity of zinc finger  containing proteins for RNA or DNA. Two zinc finger proteins,  TFIIIA and p4, provide and excellent model system for this study,  because these proteins have a similar organization of nine zinc  fingers, yet TFIIIA binds to both RNA and DNA, whereas p43 binds  only to RNA. Therefore, the differences and similarities between  these two proteins should enable us to learn which features of the  zinc finger are needed for interaction with RNA and which features  of the zinc finger are needed for interaction with RNA and which  DNA. Using recombinant DNA technology to synthesize hybrids of  TFIIIA and p43 in which different zinc fingers or parts of zinc  fingers have been combined, the specificity and affinity of  individual zinc fingers for RNA and DNA will be measured.

Machine learning, which studies the automatic  acquisition of new concepts, has largely focussed on developing  mechanisms for learning. Questions such as \"How can an AI computer  system come to form a general concept in response to a relatively  few observed training examples?\" and \"What prior knowledge is  required to support such concept acquisition?\" have dominated the  field. However, it has become clear that the unbridled acquisition  of concepts (even correct concepts) can degrade the performance of  the AI system that they are intended to help. In sophisticated  applications, such as arise in AI planning, a performance penalty  for learning can be the rule rather than the exception. Thus,  machine learning mechanisms cannot be successful unless suitably  restrained. Unfortunately, the judgement of when to learn is  itself complex. The benefit of a new concept depends on features  of the performance system as well as the machine learning  mechanism. It can also be strongly influenced by the expected  profile of tasks to be given to the performance system and by the  concepts that have previously been acquired.   The proposed research is intended to produce a fist theory of  rational learning. The learning component of an AI system is a  rational learner if the AI system's behavior is guaranteed, on  average, to be improved by the acquisition of any new concepts.  Such a theory must provide a general framework for the interactions  between a machine learning system, the performance system that  employs the acquired concepts, and characteristics of the estimated  distribution of tasks. The research will explore both empirical  and analytic approaches to estimating expected concept utility.  The area of planning will serve as a vehicle for the work, but the  results will likely be applicable to other performance systems.  Explanation-based methods form the nucleus of learning methods  since it, more than the inductive approach, seems liable to the  phenomenon of detrimental learning. The benefits of the research  will include an enumeration and taxonomy of the types of rational  learning.

Methods of analysis  vary in accordance to the time dependence of the forces involved.  For example, the forces on a slowly oscilatting airfoil can be  adequately determined using a simple quasi-steady model. More  dynamic problems, involving high angles of attack, require  numerical methods accounting for shed vorticity (characteristics  of the wake downstream of the airfoil). During the course of study  leading to a Ph.D., Mr. Diaz, under the guidance of his advisor,  Jewel Barlow, will apply a numerical method on unsteady aerodynamic  research projects currently underway at the University of Maryland.

This is so because genetic diversity is recognized as  being necessary for maintenance of healthy populations and for  determining the evolutionary potential (such as the potential for  new species to evolve) of natural populations. It is proposed  that island plant species that have evolved through adaptive  radiation (diversification into a variety of habitats from a  single introduction) can provide the model systems for analysis  of the amount and structure of genetic diversity for rare plants  in general. The genus Tetramolopium in the Sunflower family  presents a unique opportunity to analyze genetic diversity in  rare species. The genus occurs only on oceanic islands in the  Pacific Ocean and has an unusual distribution among New Guinea,  Hawaii, and the Cook Islands. Ten of the eleven Hawaiian species  are considered rare and endangered. Based on available evidence  New Guinea is the source area where Tetramolopium evolved and was  later dispersed to the other Pacific islands.  The two specific goals of the research are: 1. To assess  the initial amount of genetic diversity that was introduced into  Hawaii and compare this value to those found in the present  Hawaiian species. This will be accomplished by comparing genetic  diversity in New Guinea species to those in Hawaii through use of  two independent molecular techniques. 2. To determine how many  genes are involved in the process of adaptive radiation in  Hawaiian species and estimate the proportion of the total gene  pool represented by these genes.

Among  various applications of laser, Laser Chemical Vapor Deposition  (LCVD) and Laser Physical Vapor Deposition (LPVD) techniques can  be used to synthesize thin layers of materials with precise spatial  control. Although the potential of Laser Induced Deposition (LID)  processes as a superior technique to produce thin films has been  demonstrated, little has been done to understand the fundamentals  of such processes. For this reason, a research project  encompassing experimental studies and development of mathematical  models for the film forming process during LID for a compound such  as Titanium Nitride (TIN) is researched in order to understand the  mechanism of such processes, and to develop a science base for  laser-aided materials processing. Morphology and stoichiometry of  TiN deposits for both LPVP and LCVD will be a major interest. TiN  is chosen as the model material for the study for its wide  application in various industries such as microelectronics, opto  electronics, tool and aerospace industries. Applications of TiN  thin films as a diffusion barrier between Si and Al (for VLSI) is  often observed. The experimental studies include the determination  of optical and electronic properties and characterization by  various electron-optical techniques for TiN films formed by LID.  The surface temperature and chemical composition near the point of  deposition will also be determined. These results will be used to  obtain information about the surface-decomposition fraction and  the cluster size in the film. The chemical kinetic data will shed  light on the reaction rate law in the vapor phase during LPVD and  at the gas-solid interface during LCVD, and on the question of  enhanced reaction rate during LID.

We have isolated nuclear mutants of  Chlamydomonas that do not accumulate chloroplast transcripts for  two light-harvesting components, CP47 and CP43, of Photosystem II  reaction centers. Mutants 6.2z5 synthesizes, but does not  accumulate, psbC mRNA while GE2.10 is defective in stabilization  of several transcripts from the psbB locus. The mutants appears  to lack proteins that interact specifically with the mRNAs and  function to protect degradation. For GE2.10 however, it is also  possible the maturation of a polycistronic psbB transcript is  impaired. Our studies include: 1) completing sequencing of the  psbB locus to elucidate the products encoded by this region of  the alga's chloroplast genome and the occurrence of secondary  structures that presumably specify transcript maturation of  stabilization; 2) characterizing the primary transcripts and  products of psbB; 3) analyzing proteins from purified  chloroplasts from wildtype versus the mutant strains, that bind  to RNAs from psbB and psbC subclones; 4) isolating of genes  encoding the RNA-binding proteins by use of oligonucleotide  probes or complementation of the mutant strains by transformation  with a plasmid library of wildtype nuclear DNA; 5) if time  allows, assessing the roles of non-coding sequences of the psb  transcripts by transforming chloroplasts of the mutants and  wildtype with constructs of psbC gene fragments with psbB  flanking regions (and vice-versa).  %%%  The photosynthetic apparatus of plants and algae is formed  through the coordinated activities of two cellular compartments:  the chloroplast, where photosynthetic activities are  compartmentalized, and the nuclear/cytoplasmic chambers where  many regulatory and photosynthetic proteins are synthesized.  Although chloroplasts can synthesize a many photosynthetic  proteins, especially those involved in light energy conversion  into chemical energy, they are not autonomous with respect to  either their ability to generate functional photosynthetic  complexes or with respect to the regulation of their  photosynthetic and synthetic functions. Our work concerns  understanding how chloroplast gene expression is regulated by  proteins imported from the cytoplasm. We have found that nuclear  mutants of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas, which unlike  vascular plants can easily grown by provision of simple  carbohydrates, are defective in the accumulation of mRNAs  encoding chlorophyll-binding proteins that are made in the  chloroplast. This project is to characterize the nature of the  defect which causes the chloroplast gene products to be rapidly  degraded after they are synthesized.

Because the isolates come mainly from the model community, the  model is particularly well-suited for investigating the basis for   this discrepancy. rRNA-based hybridization probe studies of  cultivated and uncultivated phototrophic microorganisms of the  mat  provide a more focused view of the boundaries of the model  community, and permit formulation of several hypotheses that are   likely to explain the failure to detect SSU rRNAs of cultivated  species. Hypotheses are based on how trophic structure affects  abundance and how culture procedures select for microorganisms  not  adapted hypotheses, (a) a more streamlined search for SSU rRNAs  of  natural community members, (b) a comprehensive probe study to  determine the distributions and numeric relevance of all  cultivated  and uncultivated species, and (c) the cultivation of more  relevant  species using more ecologically sound approaches will be  undertaken.

This model is a precise framework attempting  to capture the notion of learning from examples. Recent progress  in machine learning and statistical inference on paradigms such as  the PAC model has provided fundamental results on the amount of  data needed for function approximation in a completely  nonparametric setting. The applicability of these paradigms is  limited by the assumptions on the data gathering mechanisms and the  performance criteria. Some of these assumptions will be relaxed  to allow the extended learning paradigm to be applied to areas such  as signal/image processing and geometric reconstruction. The  approach is to place mild assumptions on the function classes while  allowing more flexibility in the sampling and error criteria.  Specifically, the extensions proposed are to allow deterministic  sampling strategies, sampling over noncompact domains, and learning  with respect to general performance criterion. The extended model  will be applied to a variety of problems in signal processing and  geometric reconstruction to provide information complexity results  for some classical and new reconstruction/estimation problems. In  the area of signal processing, the framework will be applied to  problems dealing with tomographic image reconstruction,  multiresolution signal processing, and classical sampling theorems.  In the area of geometric reconstruction, applications to stochastic  geometry and shape form probing problems.

Additionally, it may  interact with the cellular cytoskeleton to form muscle-specific  morphology. Two key components of the triad junction, the  dihydropyridine (DHPR) and ryanodine receptors (RR), are expressed  early during embryonic chick skeletal muscle differentiation. The  aim of this project is to determine how these proteins are  incorporated into the triad junction and become active in the  release of intracellular calcium in developing skeletal muscle, and  whether the calcium release events mediated by the triad junction  influence other aspects of muscle development. The specific aims  are to: (1), define the experimental in detail by establishing the  time course of the expression of the DHPR and RR in developing  embryonic chick skeletal muscle; and (2), investigate whether these  proteins influence skeletal muscle development by testing the  hypothesis that DHPR and RR serve as organizers for the assembly  of the triad junction and its integration into mature muscle  structure. This will be done by defining the time course of  incorporation of these and other junctional components into the  junction, and assess the significance of interactions between  junctional proteins and cytoskeletal elements. Dr. Ellisman's  contribution to the project will be primarily with regard to the  morphological aspects.   Skeletal muscle provides the contractile force to move bones and  other structures, effecting organ or whole organism movement. The  signal which \"tells\" the muscle to contract and ensures synchronous  contraction along the length of the muscle involves an electrical  wave generated at the neuromuscular junction, which travels down  the length of the muscle fiber along the plasma membrane. The  conversion of the electrical signal to contraction occurs by  transduction of the electrical signal to a \"second messenger\"  signal, namely release of calcium from intracellular stores  (sarcoplasmic reticulum) into the cytoplasm. At the \"triad  junction\" of the muscle cell, the membrane of the sarcoplasmic  reticulum is closely apposed to a specialized structure of the  plasma membrane known as the transverse tubule. This highly  specialized region contains a set of unique sarcoplasmic reticulum  membrane proteins which interact with the closely apposed  transverse tubule membrane to effect the coupling of the electrical  signal to the opening of a calcium channel which allows the release  of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm.  Neither the mechanism of this signal transduction event, nor the  cellular development of this intricate subcellular structure, is  well understood.

Two groups of  neurotransmitter candidates are thought to mediate this initial  excitatory step in the pain pathway: one being excitatory amino  acids (EAA: glutamate, asparate), and another are peptides  (including tachykinins such as substance P and neurokinin A).  These peptides may be colocalized with an excitatory amino acid(s)  in the same neurons. Chemical signal transfer via such neurons  presents new aspects and complexities of presynaptic (synaptic  efficacy) and postsynaptic (membrane excitability) regulation which  have not previously been considered and may have important  implications for the performance of the somatosensory, especially  of pain pathways. Dr. Randic has recently found that substance P  and excitatory amino acids interact to produce neurophysiological  signs of hyperalgesia i.e. a prolonged enhancement of responses to  excitatory manipulation. However, the sites and the molecular  mechanisms by which the peptide signals produce enhanced EAA  responses have yet to be elucidated. Dr. Randic will examine the  hypothesis that the activation of distinct neurokinin receptors  causes modulation of the responses of freshly isolated spinal  dorsal horn neurons to EAAs, especially to N-methyl-D-aspartic-  acid (NMDA). To gain understanding of molecular mechanism(s)  underlying interactions between EAAs, and tachykinins possible  involvement of glycine allosteric site of NMDA receptor channel  complex, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) or change  in Ca++-sensitive second messenger systems, will be investigated.

There is considerable disagreement over the causes of this pattern.  One school maintains that the seasonal decline is a nonadaptive  consequences of variation in female condition, which has an  overriding effect both on timing of laying and clutch size. The  other school sees seasonal clutch size declines as an adaptive  response to variation in food availability for the laying female  or seasonally declining prospects for rearing offspring. It is  proposed to distinguish between these possibilities in three ways.  One experiment will test for the effect of food supply for the  laying female by decreasing the foraging profitability and the  condition of the female prior to laying and looking for predicted  shifts in timing of laying and clutch size. A second experiment  will alter the timing of chick-rearing. If condition has the  overwhelming effect on chick-rearing success, then the manipulation  will have no effect on offspring production across groups. If, on  the other hand, the breeding environment has a predominant effect,  offspring production will vary across groups. A statistical test  will take data on condition, clutch size, and laying date, and,  through partial regression analysis, look for a significant effect  of laying date on clutch size once condition is controlled for.  In all these tests, condition will be measured in terms of fat and  protein stores with the aid of newly developed nondestructive  techniques.

The biosynthesis process gives and  incredible regularity to 1) inorganic and protein structure at  nanoscale (atomic) dimensions, and 2) the initiation and  termination of growth at mesoscale (is greater than  approximately 0.1 microns) dimensions, thus generating the highly  ordered microlaminate composite formation that gives the  resulting biomaterial its strength and flexibility. This  interdisciplinary research will investigate the fundamental  chemical and stereochemical interactions which, at the molecular  level control such biologically mediated mineral nucleation and  growth at both the nano- and mesostructure level. Nucleation and  growth of inorganic phases will be carried out from solutions at  low temperatures and pressures on: i) inorganic and biological  mineral templates; ii) synthetic organic templates with optically  active groups and surface arrays of ionic sites similar to those  found on biopolymeric templating surfaces in vivo; and iii)  biogenic templating polypeptides. The proposed experiments will  use a novel combination of synthesis and characterization  techniques, including polypeptide sequencing and synthesis to  form structure directing templates, in situ atomic force  microscopy and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction.  %%%  Nature's use of templating involves material growth from  solutions at low temperatures and pressures, a process that is  currently only poorly understood and little used by materials  scientists. Increasingly, it is becoming apparent that these new  materials, which have been referred to as \"chemically bonded  ceramics\", have exceptional flexural strength. The proposed  activity of this research is expected to lead to the development  of new methods for the low temperature synthesis of mechanically  superior and/or highly oriented materials using nanostructure  design and synthesis techniques. It is hoped that as more light  is shed on templating mechanisms involved, templating kinetics  will be improved and template-directed materials synthesis can be  done on a faster time scale.   While the research will initially be centered around the  mineralization processes of molluscs, which specifically involves  CaCO3 growth, all multicellular organisms appear to have evolved  with chemically similar tools for carrying out genetic control  over mineral nucleation and growth. We therefore expect that our  experimentation will increase insight on related areas of  biomineralization, including bone growth. By more fully  realizing how mineralization is orchestrated in one particular  species, the answers to more complex biomineralization problems  will surely follow. Implications of our results for the medical  field are foreseeable; bone nucleation growth is based on the  same fundamental chemical and structural interactions as occurs  in mollusc shells, except that the nucleating macromolecules are  part of a bilipid membrane which encloses the mineralization  space. Thus, the study of hydroxyapatite nucleation onto such  lipid bilayer surfaces may follow. On the other hand, a greater  understanding of soluble growth inhibitors can be useful for the  prevention of undesirable crystal growth. Medical examples  include dental plaque, organ stones, hardening of the arteries,  and calcification of implanted heart valves.

Examples of such transitions include  the shift from LPs to compact disks, the change from DOS to OS/2  or Unix in personal computers, the change from black and white to  color TV, and the impending transition to high definition TV.   The purpose of this research is to analyze the transition from  one generation of technology to the next in markets where network  externalities make it desirable or essential for users to  coordinate and adopt products that are compatible. The research  focuses on the problems faced in making a centralized choice of a  new technology. Such centralized choice may be made by  government or a voluntary standard-setting organization, as is  frequently the case. For a given mew technology, the  investigators will analyze the path of consumer adoption  following standard-setting, the effects of granting strong or  weak intellectual property protection, and the timing of  standard-setting and technology introduction. In addition, the  principles involved in choosing among competing systems will be  analyzed in light of uncertainty about improvements likely to be  achieved over time and the ultimate cost of rival systems.",a9209509,Technology Transitions with Network Externalities,"October 15, 1992",$163657 (Estimated),"Daniel H.

Previous work in  my laboratory has shown that recessive mutations in any one of four  DET genes uncouple light signals from a number of light-dependent  processes, resulting in dark-grown plants that grow as light-grown  seedlings. Because det mutations are both recessive and  pleiotropic, we have proposed that the wild-type DET proteins play  a negative regulatory role in light-regulated gene expression and  development in Arabidopsis. The genetic, biochemical, and  molecular experiments proposed here seek to further define these  genes, with emphasis placed on the DET1 gene and its protein  product, DET1. A major objective of the proposed experiments is to  complete the cloning the DET1 locus. We are cloning DET1 by  chromosome walking from a nearby RFLP marker. We have cloned over  1 megabase of DNA around the chromosome walk is almost finished.  The DET1 gene will be used in biochemical and genetic experiments  to begin analysis of the molecular mechanisms of how light signals  are transduced to developmental strategies. To further elucidate  the role of DET1 in the negative regulation of the light response,  we have isolated extragenic suppressors of the det1-1 mutation.  These suppressors will be mapped and extensively characterized in  the det1- and DET+ backgrounds with respect to light-regulated gene  expression, pigment synthesis, and leaf and chloroplast  development. Finally, we plan to investigate the functional  interactions between the various det genes and other genes involved  in light signal transduction by constructing doubly mutant strains  carrying both det and various other photomorphogenetic mutations  that have been previously isolated by ourselves and others. The  interactions between the various det genes will also be determined  by analysis of doubly, triply, and quadruply mutant lines.  %%%  The date from these experiments will allow us to construct models  of the mechanisms by which light and other signals control  chloroplast development in plants.

Three  ongoing collaborative projects and one individual one are involved,  concerning (1) links represented by closed braids, with Joan S.  Birman of Columbia University, (2) planar surfaces and the cabling  conjecture, with Abigail A. Thompson of the University of  California, Davis, (3) embeddings and immersions in highly  alternating link exteriors, with Morwen B. Thistlethwaite of the  University of Tennessee, and (4) the Milnor-Bennequin conjecture  and unknotting number. (1) seeks better ways of calculating about  such links, possibly leading to a more efficient effective  algorithm than Haken's for distinguishing oriented links. (3)  builds upon a recent joint triumph in settling the hundred-year-old  Tait flyping conjecture.  Knots and their generalization, links, are rather elementary  geometric objects whose really interesting properties are  topological. By this we mean that two geometric knots do not  differ in an interesting way if one of them can be transformed to  look just like the other without cutting or untying it, just by  pushing its string about to rearrange the crossings. Topologists  say that they are two different geometric realizations of the same  topological knot. Nevertheless, it is not a trivial matter to  recognize when one complicated geometric knot is topologically  different from another, rather than just a different geometric  realization. This problem can be addressed by computing certain  numbers or polynomials which are called \"topological invariants,\"  meaning that they always have the same value for different  geometric realizations of the same topological knot. The problem  would be reduced to pure algebra if there were one invariant which  also always had different values for geometric realizations of  different topological knots, but life is not so simple -- no single  invariant achieves this ideal, nor even all the known invariants  taken together. It is therefore valuable to investigate new  invariants, some of the most useful being those inspired in recent  years by ideas from quantum physics. The investigator has been in  the thick of this activity and has been particularly successful in  applying some new polynomial invariants to settle old questions  about alternating knots.

Substantial small-sample improvements in model  selection performance are found in all cases as the bias of the  estimator for Kullback-Leibler discrepancy is greatly reduced.  The investigators propose to build on the above work by  developing a general theoretical and pracitcal foundation for  AICc as it applies to small-sample model selection problems in  time series and regression.  A central problem in statistics is that of selecting an  appropriate model from a potentially large class of candidate  models to apply in a particular situation of practical interest.  The selection of an inadequate model can have very serious  consequences: forecasts of future events may be substantially  distorted and inaccurate, resulting in incorrect decisions, and  financial losses. The development of an effective decision-  making process therefore depends on the ability to decide which  model seems best for the data at hand.

The huge size of the electron acceleration even catalog  will make it possible to subdivide by interplanetary magnetic field  Bz and By conditions, as well as indices of magnetic activity, such  as Kp and AE. That is, a result of the proposed research will be  maps of the statistical distribution of electron acceleration  events throughout the high latitude regions, at all local times and  a variety of binning conditions. Intense diffuse auroras will be  similarly studied; particular attention will be paid to instances  of ion energy fluxes exceeding that of electrons (true ion  auroras). Finally, the entire catalog of 500,000 electron  acceleration events will be shared with the general ionospheric  community. convenient access to the entire list of auroras  encountered by DMSP satellites on any specified day between  December 1983 and December 1990 will also be provided.

Some of the problems are designed to expand the uses of the  methods of boundedly controlled topology by applying them to  problems in other areas, while others lie entirely within the  domain of boundedly controlled topology itself. Attempts to  expand the scope of the methods are intended to demonstrate their  relevance and clarify their limitations and may expose additional  questions within the subject which need to be addressed. The  problems within the area itself represent extensions of research  already done by Anderson and H. J. Munkholm of Odense, Denmark.

Topology is the study of properties of geometric objects  which are not destroyed by continuous transformations, such  properties as connectedness, knottedness, and so forth.

Shock waves, turbulent mixing zones, flame fronts,  solidification fronts, and fluid and material interfaces provide  examples of the types of waves considered here. The  investigators analyze first the regular case, in which a small  number of waves meet at a point and propagate in a self-similar  fashion, as a traveling wave with definite velocity and with  definite relativeangles. This problem is related to, but more  difficult than, the one-dimensional Riemann problem, with which  the investigators and coworkers have prior experience. Secondly,  they consider the case of chaotic higher dimensional wave  interactions, characterized by unstable interfaces, mixing  regions, and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. In this  chaotic case, they identify elementary modes, which interact to  form an effective statistical ensemble. The study of the chaotic  case depends upon the renormalization group, and methods to  reduce the number of effective degrees of freedom. Fixed points  of the renormalization group found by the investigators and  coworkers to characterize chaotic mixing regimes suggest  directions for research.  One of the most difficult aspects of the study of wave  propagation is the computation of nonlinear wave interactions.  This project is to study the mathematical structure of such  interactions and to use this analysis to improve computer  programs that model flows where wave interactions are important.  Flows of this type occur in a wide variety of industrial,  military, and scientific applications, including supersonic  flight, sheet metal forming and die pressing, weather prediction,  fluid turbulence, projectile penetration of armor, blast waves,  and astrophysics. All of these areas are characterized by  sensitive dependence on the detailed structures produced by the  nonlinear interaction of waves, and thus share many common  mathematical aspects.

The next generation of  supercomputers will require an increase in  speed. Unfortunately, since the residual stress  in the dielectric increases with the number of  layers, the reliability of the dielectric layer  based on current polyimides will decrease.  The increase in layers and the decrease in the  width of the circuit paths necessitates the use  of photosensitive polyimides which typically  exhibit a reduction in properties. Thus, there  is a pressing need to 1) produce polyimides  with lower residual stress and 2) learn how to  optimize a mechanical design utilizing these  materials using structural analysis methods.   First, DuPont will prepare a number of new,  non-photosensitive polyimides that have low  stress.

The PI will study the characteristics  of these interactions in a fully nonlinear general circulation  model with an ocean covered earth (\"aqua-planet\"). Preliminary  experiments with the model show strong eastward propagation at  periods between 10-15-days. The oscillation is equatorially  trapped with maximum amplitude in the upper troposphere. The  disturbances appear to exhibit both Kelvin and Rossby wave  characteristics, possibility suggesting that the disturbances are  coupled Kelvin-Rossby waves. The hypothesis has been put forth  that the vertical profile of convective heating defines the phase  speed of propagation observed in the model and the real atmosphere.  It is suggested that interacting vertical modes excited by the  diabetic heating lead to propagating wave-CISK modes. The PI will  critically examine this hypothesis in the \"aqua-planet\" general  circulation model. The preferential excitement of the slowest  modes over the warmest waters in the observations is inadequately  explained by the hypothesis.

Like  other marine organisms, sea urchins contain mycosporine-like amino  acids (MAAs), which absorb environmentally relevant wavelengths of  UV (310-360 nm). MAAs are presumably algal, bacterial or fungal  products, animals not being known to synthesize them, so their  provenance in sea urchins is uncertain. Various seaweeds are rich  in MAAs, and preliminary chromatographic analyses indicate  concordance between the MAA complements in seaweeds and in sea  urchin tissues, especially ovaries. Maintenance of sea urchins on  controlled diets of seaweeds lacking or rich in MAAs, subsequent  analysis of gut contents and tissues, testing the ability of gut  tissues to absorb MAAs should confirm whether MAAs are so obtained.

The principal topics of the proposed  research are the probability transformations of rainfall rate from  the plot scale, at which physical process representations can be  applied for land surface processes, to the observation scale of  climatological remote sensing systems, and from the observation  scale to the climate model scale. A statistical model of raindrop  processes (Smith ?1991!) will be used to examine these  transformations. The model of raindrop processes yields a  stochastic/dynamic representation of rainfall rate and provides a  unified framework for studying land surface processes related to  rainfall rate and atmospheric processes related to remote sensing  measurements of rainfall. In this study, empirical and theoretical  analyses will be carried out for rainfall rate and raindrop  processes. The lognormal cascade theory of Gupta and Waymire  ?1990! will play an important role in both empirical and  theoretical scaling analyses. Two principal problems will be  examined:   *How do distributional properties of rainfall rate and  raindrop processes vary with scale?  *How does rainfall rate depend on raindrop processes and how  does this relationship vary with scale?

This is so because genetic diversity is recognized as  being necessary for maintenance of healthy populations and for  determining the evolutionary potential (such as the potential for  new species to evolve) of natural populations. It is proposed  that island plant species that have evolved through adaptive  radiation (diversification into a variety of habitats from a  single introduction) can provide the model systems for analysis  of the amount and structure of genetic diversity for rare plants  in general. The genus Tetramolopium in the Sunflower family  presents a unique opportunity to analyze genetic diversity in  rare species. The genus occurs only on oceanic islands in the  Pacific Ocean and has an unusual distribution among New Guinea,  Hawaii, and the cook Islands. Ten of the eleven Hawaiian species  are considered rare and endangered. Based on available evidence  New Guinea is the source area where Tetramolopium evolved and was  ater dispersed to the other Pacific islands.  The two specific goals of the research are: 1. To assess  the initial amount of genetic diversity that was introduced into  Hawaii and compare this value to those found in the present  Hawaiian species. This will be accomplished by comparing genetic  diversity in New Guinea species to those in Hawaii through use of  two independent molecular techniques. 2. To determine how many  genes are involved in the process of adaptive radiation in  Hawaiian species and estimate the proportion of the total gene  pool represented by these genes. This will be one of the first  non-domesticated plant species to have the number of genes  controlling morphological differences determined and mapped.

It contains a  sequence of nonmarine deposits about 12,000 feet thick that ranges  in age from about 5 to 0.7 Ma, yields remains of fossil mammals  throughout the sequence, and contains lithologies amenable to  magnetostratigraphic and isotopic age analysis. The deposits, the  Mt. Eden and San Timoteo formations, occur in well exposed outcrops  of an anticline that plunges gently northwestward and is truncated  on its southwestern edge by the currently active San Jacinto fault.  The San Jacinto, the most active strand of the San Andreas fault  system in southern California, underwent about 24 km of right slip  during the past two million years. Paleocurrent data indicate that  the sediments were transported to the San Timoteo basin from the  north and northeast. Distinctive clast suites in the rocks are  consistent with derivation from sources in those directions now  northeast of the Badlands; some east of the present San Andreas  fault (s.s). The San Timoteo beds thus are ideally situated in  space and time to promote investigations of the slip history of  elements of the San Andreas fault system during the past 5 million  years. These beds are the only sequence that accumulated  relatively continuously during this span of time in this part of  southern California.  A detailed analysis of age of these beds has never been  attempted. The program of age analysis will include vertebrate  paleontology and biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy and isotope  chronology. If successful, the results will dramatically improve  our ability to attempt a reconstruction of the sedimentary history  of the San Timoteo beds, and palinspastic reconstructions of the  tectonic block that contains them relative to the then adjacent  terranes in this region. The data also will be valuable in  addressing the timing of transfer of regional slip from the San  Andreas fault strands (s.s) to the San Jacinto fault, will improve  our ability to evaluate when and how the entire San Andreas system  became effectively \"locked\" in this region; will sharpen the focus  of local investigations of slip rates on the San Andreas, and on  how regional shear between the Pacific and American plates is  propagated through the Transverse Ranges province.",a9204925,"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Neogene Sediments of the San Timoteo Badlands, Southern California: Implications along the San Andreas and San Jacinto Faults","July 15, 1992",$30328 (Estimated),Christopher G.

This will be the second such  conference, the first being held in 1990. Although considerable  progress has been made in defining the mature structure of animal  and plant virions, much less is known of the intracellular  processes directing the assembly of newly synthesized  macromolecules into infectious highly organized virion particles.  These processes are likely to be virus specific and so targets for  therapeutic intervention. Some recent findings have included the  role of chaperonins in structural protein maturation,  phosphorylation of viral structural subunits, non-conservation of  symmetry in polyoma, and interference of the products of cloned  genes with virus infection. Such results led to the organization  of the first FASEB conference on \"Viral Assembly\" in 1990 as it was  realized there was and urgent need to examine and integrate the  current knowledge of intracellular assembly of infectious virions.  The urgency arose from the fact that the last relevant conference  was held over seven years previously (EMBL, 1982). The 1992 FASEB  conference will be build on the success of the 1990 conference in  bringing together leading investigators in the fields of assembly  and maturation of animal, plant and bacterial viruses. A  particularly important and well-received feature of the 1990  conference was its organizations of sessions around specific  processes and problems in virus assembly, rather than around  particular viruses. This led to an interchange and merging of  knowledge from research workers in the fields of animal viruses and  bacteriophages. Until the advent of the FASEB meetings, these  communities had grown apart and so had no common forum. Poster  sessions, in addition to the oral sessions, will ensure an even  wider communication of results among attendees and guarantee that  late-breaking or newly-developing investigations will be adequately  covered.

In quartet, GDI  fails to undergo a post-translational modification, and processes  regulated by GTP-binding proteins are altered. Prominent among the  anomalies in quartet are changes in mitotic behavior; mitotic  chromosomal separation is blocked.

Reversible phosphonate ester  inhibitors of serine hydrolases might be used as blocking  agents in pretreatment against soman and sarin.  The specific goal of this project is the modeling of  interactions between fully hydrated trypsin, chymotrypsin or  acetylcholinesterase and organophosphorus inhibitors: 2-propyl  and pinacolyl methyphosphonofluoridates, 4-nitrophenyl 4-  substituted-phenacyl methylphosphonates.

Thousands of biologists are working on this  organism to understand many fundamental biological processes.  Worldwide interest in mouse-ear cress stems from the fact that this  organism has the smallest and simplest genome among flowering  plants, has a generation time of four to six weeks, and has a small  size to 30 cm high (because of its small size, dozens can be grown  in a small pot and several hundred thousands in a small room).  These and several other attributes make the plant ideal for basic  studies in biology. Yet the very basic information on Arabidopsis,  especially on its nearest relatives, limits, number of species, and  various aspects of its individual species is almost non-existent.  To understand the origin of this organism, basic systematic studies  on the genus are urgently needed, and living material of all taxa  should be made available. The proposed research is designed to  address these very problems.  Intensive field work will be done in central Asia, especially  the adjacent portions of China, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan,  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, which represent the center  of greatest diversity of the genus. Seed collections will be  deposited at the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio  State, where they will be made available to botanists worldwide.  Extensive systematic studies based on herbarium material from more  than 80 herbaria will be conducted, and detailed studies on the  morphology, reproductive biology, cytology, seed anatomy, and  chemistry of Arabidopsis and its relatives will be done.

The theory as  developed over the past decade has proved its worth through  important applications to problems in signal processing, data  compression, and seismic exploration, to name a few. The  advantages of wavelet decompositions of functions over more  traditional harmonic analysis techniques lies in the ability of  properly chosen wavelets to remain local in time and frequency: a  function and its Fourier transform have representations whose  coefficients depend only on the values of the function in small  neighborhoods distributed throughout space. Most wavelet  analysis focuses on the representation or approximation of  functions defined on the entire line or throughout space. There  is a need to develop wavelet analyses for functions restricted to  intervals. That is one of the primary goals of this project.  One cannot take a wavelet theory and simply restrict it to an  interval. The end points create obstacles which preclude the use  of a single wavelet. At issue then is how efficiently can a  wavelet theory be built on intervals in the sense of using the  minimal number of auxiliary functions and maintaining the same  qualities of the wavelet theory.  One drawback of wavelets is their lack of symmetry. This  shortcoming can be overcome by using a construction of dual Riesz  bases of symmetric wavelets (one forfeits the use of a single  wavelet to do all the work and replaces it by two). The  adaptation of wavelets to finite intervals also opens the  possibility for the construction of dual bases in this context.  Very little work has been done in this direction to date,  although applications to image processing appear to be very  promising. One simple approach to this dual basis construction  is to consider truncations of existing infinitely supported  wavelets used in various applications and truncating them. These  may provide interesting dual bases but they will only be of value  if their conditioning numbers can be held close to unity.

What is not clear is how  nutrition and selection might interact with each other in the  enhancement of survival, given that both are affected by this type  of trade-off. The central questions for this project revolve  around this interaction: (i) Can genetic trade-offs between  survival and reproduction be surmounted by nutritional  manipulation?

For most insects including planthoppers (Homoptera:  Delphacidae), there is a reproductive cost associated with  dispersal ability as evidenced by the reduced fecundity and delayed  oviposition of migratory compared to flightless females.  Corresponding information for males on the relationship between  dispersal ability and reproductive success is virtually absent. As  a result, our understanding of the evolution, maintenance, and  population consequences of variation in dispersal capability is  based almost exclusively on females. Failure to establish fitness  differences between male wing forms challenges our current  knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary basis for the  existence of dispersal polymorphisms. Several characteristics of  planthopper mating systems suggest the presence of costs associated  with migratory ability in males and that migratory and flightless  males contribute differentially to population dynamics at different  densities. The research outlined herein seeks to elucidate  intrinsic differences between migratory and flightless males of the  planthopper Prokelisia dolus in their 1) competitive ability (male  / male interactions, ability to locate mates, attractiveness to  females, 2) survivorship, propensity to disperse, ability to  inseminate mates, and 3) mating success and contribution to  population growth across a range of density conditions.

Consequently, there now exists a rich  diversity of theory pertaining to biased sex ratios. Meiotic  drive, cytoplasmic inheritance and other non-Mendelian mechanisms  of sex ratio distortion may play a major role in the evolution of  biased sex ratios. Meiotic drive systems, including sex ratio  distorters, may be central to our understanding of evolutionary  processes such as sex chromosome evolution, the evolution and  diversity of sex determining mechanisms, and the origin of  sterility barriers between species (including Haldane's Rule).  Initial research has shown that certain families of Silene alva, a  dioecious plant, exhibit severely female biased sex ratios.  Studies involving molecular markers of the Y chromosome show that  the vias is present in the seed and is therefore, not due to a  higher mortality of male progeny. Sex ratio bias is inherited  through or expressed in the male parent. This pattern of  inheritance and other circumstantial evidence lead one suspect and  X-linked meiotic drive system may be responsible for the evolution  of the female bias. The proposed research will determine the  genetic basis of sex ratio distortion in Silene alba  by using reciprocal crosses and backcrosses. RAPD markers,  will be used to investigate specifically how and when the female  bias develops. Crosses among geographically separated populations  and among closely related species will be used to detect  sex ratio distortion which is normally suppressed by restorers.  Finally, whether the structure of natural populations  of Silene alba is consistent with other mechanisms of selection for  biased sex ratios will be determined. These results will provide  information the nature and diversity of genetic mechanisms  influencing sex ratio in natural populations. Moreover, because  sex chromosome markers and wide crosses represent unique approaches  to studying sex ratio genetics,it is expected that methods will  stimulate research into mechanisms of sex ratio bias in other  species.",a9207893,The Genetic Basis of Sex Ratio Distortion in Silene Alba,"August 1, 1992",$203071 (Estimated),Mark W.

The  increasing size and decreasing cost of semiconductor memory has  prompted research into databases which are memory resident.  These Main Memory DataBase (MMDB) systems are aimed at high  throughput applications such as airline reservation systems,  phone switching databases, and other real time systems where the  availability of the memory resident data is crucial. To achieve  this high availability with volatile RAM requires a backup  archive database on disk as well as efficient algorithms to  checkpoint the database to the archive and to recover it from the  archive to main memory after a system failure. It has been shown  that MMDB systems often perform better with deferred update  techniques where data to be updated is first placed in a special  nonvolatile shadow area and only at transaction commit time is  placed in main memory. The authors are investigating both  checkpointing and reloading of MMDB databases with the use of  more conventional immediate update (IU) techniques as well as  deferred update (DU) strategies. The best checkpointing  approaches are to be determined as are partial reloading  strategies. A partial reload allows the database to be brought  online after a system failure faster because not all of the MMDB  is reloaded prior to bringing the system up. This research  represents the first examination of techniques for partial  reloading of MMDB systems. Due to the volatility of RAM, the  high throughput needs of MMDB applications, and the potential for  partial reloading to dramatically increase the uptime of database  systems, the results and impact of this research are both  widespread and significant.",a9201643,In Memory Database Recovery Issues,"September 15, 1992",$202998 (Estimated),Y.

The neural network studies are based on Voltage Controlled  Oscillator model Neurons (VCONs), which are constructible  electronic devices that have interesting mathematical models and  many parallels with physiological nerve cells. The investigators  have recently derived VCON networks that filter, process, and  store information based on frequency encoding; they extend and  refine this work in parallel with known physiological circuits.  The mathematical aspects of interest in this are rotation vectors  and generalized Fourier analysis of dynamical systems. The  applied aspects are related to the design and study of circuits  that can reproduce known functions of parts of mammalian brains  based on frequency encoding and decoding. Specifically, the  investigators study tonotopic mappings, storage and retrieval of  messages, and the structure and function of processing circuits  similar to neocortical columns. The second part of this proposal  studies populations and genetics. The investigators focus on  food chains and colony synchronization in bacterial communities,  pattern formation in bacterial lawns, and plasmid stability in  genetically engineered microorganisms. Computational methods  developed for simulation of VCON networks are applied to study  bacterial communities.  The project involves two problems in mathematical biology  that illustrate two important contributions that mathematics  makes to the life sciences: First, mathematics enables us to  analyze large networks that resemble parts of our brains, and  second, mathematical formulations enable us to use scientific  computers to predict the outcome of experiments that are  expensive or difficult to perform. First, the investigators  study large collections of electronic devices that mimic brain  circuits. These devices (called VCONs) are based on phase-locked  loops that are widely used in electronic communications. They  have designed, analyzed, and simulated VCON networks that focus  attention on the most persistent among many competing stimuli,  and that memorize and recall messages. They extend this work to  include other aspects of the brain, including parts of the  hippocampus. The novelty of this work is that it is based on  frequency encoded information rather than discrete information  bits, as in digital computers. As a result, the networks are  quite stable, even functioning well when partially destroyed. In  the second part of this work, they use methods developed for VCON  networks to study problems about bacterial communities. While  these two problem areas are widely separated, certain  mathematical aspects of the two are remarkably similar: Bacteria  lead oscillatory lives, and using the methods for large networks  of VCON oscillators, the investigators are able to describe in  mathematical terms large communities of bacteria -- for example,  as arising in soil.

She  proposes to continue her studies on the dec-1 gene, an eggshell  gene that is exceptional in terms of its size, mutability,  production of alternatively spliced transcripts, and post-  translational protein modifications. In addition, she will expand  her studies to include other eggshell genes so that she can begin  to establish functional interrelationships among the eggshell  proteins. Studies are proposed in three areas. First, antibodies  that have been raised against different regions of the dec-1 gene  will be used to study proteolytic processing of the three dec-1  primary translation products and their derivatives. Second,  product specific antibodies will be used to localize different  eggshell proteins in assembling and mature eggshells. By  comparing the distribution of different eggshell proteins in wild  type and mutant eggshells, she hopes to gain insight into  protein-protein interactions that are important in eggshell  assembly. Third, by structural and functional comparisons of the  dec-1 gene in evolutionarily distant species, she hopes to  identify molecular features of the dec-1 gene that are essential  for its function.

The investigator intends to  work on three topics in applied descriptive set theory, that is, on  some connections which exist between descriptive set theory and  some other parts of mathematics, specifically (1) classification of  pointsets in the projective hierarchy, (2) descriptive set theory  and finer topologies, (3) descriptive set theory and Polish group  actions. All three topics are related to analysis and topology.  The third topic is also related to other parts of mathematical  logic, such as Vaught's Conjecture and the theory of definable  cardinality. Some of the problems in the project will be  considered under the assumption of strong set theoretic axioms such  as the axiom of determinacy.  Considering that the real numbers can be thought of as the  ordinary number line of grade school arithmetic, it is surprising  how much structure can be imposed upon them and how intricate the  questions that can be asked about this structure. Descriptive set  theory is the theory that addresses these questions with all the  machinery of modern mathematical logic. For example, a standard  construct of this theory is the Borel hierarchy of sets, consisting  of two infinite sequences of families of sets, the Pi sets and the  Sigma sets, defined inductively, and hence of increasing  complexity. One of the obvious applications of the theory is to  locate precisely in this hierarchy a particular set which arises in  analysis, say the set of points at which a function is  differentiable. In fact, it is a typical and classical theorem of  descriptive set theory (due to Mazurkiewicz) that any such set of  differentiability belongs to the family Pi-one-one in the Borel  hierarchy.

This canopy phenology is an extremely sensitive indicator  of the many factors such as climate, soil moisture, and land use  that affect natural vegetation. At coarse spatial scales, the  phenology of natural vegetation is strongly correlated with  climate. In order to understand how phenology may be used as an  indicator of climate change it is necessary to establish first  the baseline variation in phytophenological rhythms under current  types of environmental variation. Multitemporal observations of  phenology made from satellite platforms provide a unique way of  assessing ecosystem dynamics at a variety of spatial and temporal  scales and thus provide a crucial link between local-scale  studies and global data sets. This study will use multitemporal  satellite, climate, and ground reference data to document and  model regional canopy phenology in several different extensive,  but contrasting, plant communities in south-central Africa. The  project will use field data and satellite imagery to reveal  contrasts in regional-scale phenology and to validate the  satellite measurements.  Increased climatic variation under enhanced greenhouse  conditions is expected to produce severe disruptions in the  annual life cycles of many organisms.

Recently a number of researchers have introduced a variety of high order splittings of the exponential into products of exponentials, leading to high order FFT based methods. The  investigator and collaborators have established that the exponentials can be replaced by Pade approximants yielding finite-difference or finite-element methods and also that high order splittings are possible in the time-dependent case. The first part of this proposal is to extend the applicability of these methods. The investigator and collaborators have introduced Lanczos reduction techniques for approximating the reflection coefficient associated with the planar interface of two inhomogeneous refractive index media. The second part of this proposal is to develop accurate and rapid high order wide-angle approximations to the Helmholtz equation base on Lanczos reduction, making it feasible to model highly divergent beams in components such as reflectors and microprisms. The investigator is also examining the possibility of using propagation techniques to accurately generate soliton solutions to a variety of nonlinear Schrodinger equations. The investigator has, in collaboration with electrical engineers, developed techniques for mathematically modeling the propagation of light through electro-optical devices, such as waveguides, filters, gratings, corner  reflectors, switches and modulators. The ability to use computers to simulate light passing through devices reduces the time and cost involved in designing new devices by cutting the number of actual physical models that are needed in the process. The results of these collaborations are already in use at a  variety of research and development centers, inclu ding Hughes Aircraft, Corning Glass, AMOCO Technology Center, Bell Northern Research, NIST. The range of applicability of the modeling techniques and their efficiency must keep pace with the constant introduction of new materials and the down-sizing of components. It is anticipated that the proposed research will provide some of these improved modeling techniques and thereby will have an economic and strategic impact on technologies based on these devices, including optical communications.

This photoconversion process occurs via a  series of fast and highly specific electron transfer reactions  that separate charge across the RC (and thus across the  membrane) with unity quantum yield. The ultimate goal of this  work is to arrive at a comprehensive understanding of this  process at a molecular level. To this end, transient absorption  spectroscopic measurements spanning the femtosecond to  millisecond timescales as well as other spectroscopic studies  will be carried out to directly identify and study the  intermediate states of charge separation and the rates and yields  of their formation and decay. These studies will be carried out  on both wild-type RCs and a wide variety of mutant RCs in which  one or more amino acids are changed. Numerous unresolved issues  regarding the involvement of specific chromophores in the pathway  of electron transfer, and the selectivity (or directionality) of  these reactions will be addressed. Factors underlying the  balancing of the competition between the forward electron  transfer reactions and the deactivating (or back) reactions will  be investigated. These studies will also address the role of the  protein in the charge separation process, both at the level of  specific amino acids and at a more global level. The results of  this work will be compared with predictions from various  theoretical models for electron transfer and, indeed, will likely  form the basis for further theoretical developments.  %%%  The conversion of light energy into chemical energy is essential  for life on earth.

In the study of wavelets,  beyond the mathematical analysis a major focus is on applications  to real-time (or on-line) time-frequency analysis. Hence the  investigators study the analysis and algorithmic and  computational aspects of spline-wavelets and non-orthogonal  wavelet packets. In particular, they will design a  predictor-corrector algorithm along the line of the Kalman filter  to implement the spline-wavelet decomposition without truncation  and to take care of noise processes such as white noise. The  research on multivariate splines also extends to the construction  of multivariate wavelets using box splines. One of the most  difficult problems is the study of minimum supports that give  rise to reconstruction sequences with minimum length. Again a  predictor-corrector algorithm will be implemented to avoid  truncation of the decomposition sequences. \"Radial basis  functions\" is a tool that allows fiting both regular and  scattered data by continuously differentiable functions. Certain  matrices associated with interpolation and approximation  processes arise in connection with the data fitting. The  investigators will study the \"stability\" of these matrices. They  also consider various aspects of the question of how rapidly the  approximating surfaces approach the underlying surface from which  the scattered data are sampled as the number of data points  increases.  The wavelet transform is a tool that cuts up data or  functions as well as their spectra into different frequency  components and then studies each component with a resolution  matched to the appropriate scale. For example, given a signal,  one is interested in \"cutting\" up its frequency content with  local time-information. This is similar to music notation, which  tells the player which notes to play at any given moment.  Wavelets, wavelet transforms, and wavelet packets help in  analyzing signals and data. Wavelet analysis is useful in data  reduction, which already has been applied to high-definition T.V.  Using wavelets, the investigators aim at decomposing and  reconstructing signals as simply and accurately as possible.  Another aim is to represent the underlying processes generating  scattered data by means of \"simple\" radial functions. This  allows one to analyze and extrapolate data, which is important  for artificial learning devices.",a9206928,"Mathematical Sciences: Wavelets, Mulivariate Splines, and Radial Functions","September 1, 1992",$225000 (Estimated),Deborah Lockhart  DMS DIVISION OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES  MPS DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN,"August 31, 1996 (Estimated)",Charles K.

While much of connectionist research has addressed problems and  data from cognitive psychology, SSP has focused on complementary  data and problems in higher cognition that are centrally located  in linguistics and the foundations of cognitive science. SSP has  already made significant progress, including (a) mathematical  techniques for representing symbolic structures as lower-level  distributed patterns of activity and for (b) performing  massively parallel structure-sensitive processing on such  representations; (c) the analysis of connectionist computation  as maximizing Harmony, a well-formedness measure on  representations; (d) contributions to theoretical linguistics in  the areas of syntax/semantics and phonology that rely on using  Harmony to measure the well-formedness of linguistic structures;  and (e) contributions to the foundations of cognitive science  deriving from the interpretation of the preceding results.   The new research to be supported by the present grant will build  on (d), expanding the theory of grammar as a well-formedness  optimizing system, and on (e), systematically developing a  typology of strategies for connectionist-grounded explanations of  the striking productivity of human higher cognition.   SSP is contributing to the development of a new methodology for  cognitive science which is more than just the sum of those of  its sister disciplines, a methodology capable of yielding  results which are beyond the reach of all the other disciplines  proceeding individually. By integrating linguistic,  philosophical, and mathematical analysis, computer simulation,  and techniques from both discrete and continuous computation,  this new methodology can develop more powerful connectionist  systems, innovative symbolic formalisms, and general cognitive  principles that constitute real progress towards the unification  of connectionist and symbolic theories of brain and mind.",a9209265,Towards an Integrated Connectionist/Symbolic Theory of Higher Cognition (REU Supplement),"August 1, 1992",$117000 (Estimated),"Paul G.

Brown will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will  conduct excavation and survey at the Post Classic Mayan site of  Mayapan which is located in Yucatan, Mexico. His project builds  on previous work at the site which resulted in extensive mapping  and excavation. This has shown that Mayapan was a very large and  very densely settled community surrounded by a massive wall over  9 km long. Outside the ceremonial center of the site, several  thousand structures, the majority of them apparently residential  in function, have been located. These appear to be subdivided  into geographicaly distinct groups. Mr. Brown will excavate in  carefully selected areas of the site in an attempt to understand  spatial patterning in artifact type. He will dig in 2 meter  squares and collect what are likely to be large samples of  ceramics, stone tools and faunal remains. Because of their  plastic nature, ceramics are often reveal fine levels of  stylistic variation. Mayapan is particularly important because  early Spanish settlers described the site and Yucatec-language  documents are also available. These sources will aid  significantly in the interpretation of the archaeological data.   Mr. Brown wishes to understand how large Mayan sites such as  Mayapan functioned. How were large numbers of people subdivided  into smaller groups, what patterns of interaction were observed  and how were people governed? While much work has been conducted  on the impressive ceremonial centers at Mayan sites very little  is known about how communities functioned. On the basis of  historic documents Mr. Brown has formulated a series of  hypotheses and the archaeological materials to be collected will  provide the data to test them.

These lichen woodlands are predominantly fire produced.  With the suppression of forest fire and the continued northward  movement of logging activity in northwestern Ontario, timber  harvest is replacing fire as the most prevalent cause of large-  scale disturbance in the lichen rich forests of the region.  Although the effects of forest fire on reindeer lichens and  patterns of terrestrial lichen succession are well-documented,  little is known about how timber harvest affects reindeer lichens  or about post-harvest reindeer lichen regeneration. This study  will examine changes in biomass, percent cover, species  composition, and growth rates of reindeer lichens that survive  timber harvest in lichen woodlands and those that colonize  harvested sites on two soil types in several regions of  northwestern Ontario. Sampling will cover five time-since-  disturbance classes for different sites. Data will be  statistically analyzed for differences in biomass, percent cover,  growth rates and species compositions of reindeer lichens on  sites of various age classes, disturbance types, and soil types.  Results of this research will provide an increased understanding  of the rate at which reindeer lichens survive timber harvest, the  rate of recovery of lichen biomass on harvested sites, and the  roles of lichens that survive and colonize harvested sites in  post-harvest recovery.  The effect of timber harvest on lichen abundance is  significant because of the importance of reindeer lichens to  woodland caribou. Woodland caribou winter in lichen woodlands  and feed on the reindeer lichens. Destruction of habitat and the  associated decrease in reindeer lichen availability has been  proposed as a cause of the decline in caribou numbers. The  findings from this study will elucidate some of the processes in  reindeer lichen recovery following fire and harvest, and they  will inform management policy of woodland caribou for whom  reindeer lichen are the primary winter fodder.",a9208169,Doctoral Dissertation Research in Geography and Regional Science,"July 15, 1992",$5261 (Estimated),"Brian Holly  BCS DIVISION OF BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE SCI SBE DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","December 31, 1993 (Estimated)",Stanley R.

The multiphase structure of these fields is reflected  in the unusual properties of their large deviations  probabilities, due to the phenomenon of formation of crystals of  different phases in typical large deviation configurations.  Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a  product of the twentieth century. It is founded firmly in the  last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter  and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance,  electro-magnetism, and heat radiation. The mathematical  foundations for these developments, collectively called  mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of  Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles,  to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known  forces into a single theory.",a9208029,Mathematical Sciences: Research in Phenomena Occurring in Disordered Systems and in Statistical Mechanics,"July 1, 1992",$157069 (Estimated),Joe W.

Weinberger studies the surgery theory of stratified  spaces, using analytic as well as topological techniques.  Rothenberg studies equivariant surgery theory and other aspects  of discrete group actions on manifolds. The visitor, Madsen, is  collaborating on this project. May studies various areas of  equivariant algebraic topology and, with Kriz, has begun work on  motives in algebraic geometry. Swan works on problems connected  with K-thoery and the study of algebraic and topological vector  bundles, Kriz has moved from the general areas of combinatorics  and is now studying various problems in algebraic topology,  including an algebraic approach to mod p homotopy theory.  The details of these various projects vary, but all are  concerned in one way or another with reducing geometric  information to a subject for calculation. The nature of the  geometric information involved is the crux of the problem. While  questions about lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth  virtually cry out to be reduced to calculations, it is far  different with what are known as topological properties of  geometric objects. These are properties such as connectedness  (being all in one piece), knottedness, having no holes, and so  forth. All systematic study of such properties, for example, how  to tell whether two geometric objects really differ in respect to  one of these properties or are only superficially different, or  how to classify the variety of differences that can occur, all  these have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they  have been reduced to matters of calculation. Modern algebra  furnishes many of the tools and the attitudes toward the tools  that are needed, but the interplay between the algebra and the  topology remains a fascinating subject.

The motivation for the research is the extensive  literature on stochastic models based on phase-type distributions.  Many of these models may be solved by straight forward algorithms.  If these are to be used in applications, then methods are needed  for specifying the phase-type distributions involved. There is  much research underway on fitting phase-type distributions,  motivated by the algorithms available for them. This research  emphasizes fitting low-order distributions. The reason for this  emphasis is that the size of the state space of a model, and hence  also the computational burden in solving it, typically depend  multiplicatively on the orders of the phase-type distributions used  in the model. Thus it is important to keep the order as small as  possible. This direction in fitting phase-type distributions has  not been explored systematically to date.

Potsherds collected in the course of prior  archaeological research in the region will be dated by both  thermolumenescence and radiocarbon dating of adhering organic  materials. Changing paleoenvironment will be reconstructed  through the analysis of hyrax dung middens. This latter is a  technique pioneered by Dr. Sampson. Hyrax are small territorial  animals who return over generations to favored habitation sites.  Resultant dung middens can span centuries and can be dated by  radiocarbon. Because the contained material includes pollen  grains, these latter can be analyzed to provide insight into  changing climatic conditions.

The equations of interest arise in mathematical  physics and differential geometry. Emphasis will be placed on  the study of the Yamabe problem in a complete Riemannian  manifold, a problem of considerable interest which can be  formulated in terms of semi-linear elliptic equations. The  problem is then one of finding positive solutions to the  equations and analyzing their asymptotic behavior. This work  motivates in a natural way efforts to understand a larger class  of solutions by means of critical points of the Sobolev quotient.  The solutions are believed to be infinitely differentiable in the  complement of sets whose Hausdorff dimension is precisely  estimated by means of the nonlinear term in the differential  equation. Work will also be done on harmonic maps, particularly  in studying the regularity of minimizing harmonic maps into  singular objects like varifolds. A recent new proof of the  regularity of minimizing harmonic maps between two compact  Riemannian manifolds suggests that an expansion is possible to  target domains which are Lipschitz graphs. Most of the attention  is paid to the sets of regularity for harmonic maps. But there  are now some general results concerning the singular sets as  well. They may have reasonable structures, such as curves or  unions of smooth curves. Further work will be done to determine  what classifications of singular sets are possible.

The Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition in the  eastern North Atlantic during June 1992, is a multinational effort  designed to improve our capability for studying cloud-chemistry  interactions and the air/sea fluxes that affect them. The specific  goals of the MAGE atmospheric chemistry experiment in ASTEX  include: 1) develop and test a Lagrangian strategy for studying  chemical and meteorological evolution in a tagged airmass, using  ships, balloons, and aircraft; 2) develop and test new techniques  for estimating trace-gas and aerosol fluxes across the air/sea  interface by comparison with traditional approaches; 3) evaluate  the impact of marine and continental aerosols and the formation and  dissipation of stratocumulus clouds; 4) compare the impacts of  natural and anthropogenic sulfur, halogens, and hydrocarbons on  marine aerosol chemistry; and 5) use a multinational, multi-agency  field experiment as a means for addressing tropospheric chemistry  issues.   In this MAGE proposal, the PIs propose to conduct measurements  of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in ocean water and sulfur dioxide and DMS  in air from shipboard in the study area of ASTEX. The primary  objective is to determine the DMS content in the ocean along the  track of the parcel sampled in a Lagrangian experiment. The PIs  propose to compute the DMS flux along the parcel trajectory using  a thin film model. Then, the DMS flux data would be used to reduce  the number of variables in the Lagrangian budget analysis or to  test the reliability of DMS flux data obtained directly from the  budget analysis. Secondary objectives include the determination of  DMS and sulfur dioxide in air before and after the air parcel  passes over the ship. These data would provide information on the  horizontal variation of DMS and sulfur dioxide upwind and downwind  of the air parcel. These measurements would compliment those  obtained from an aircraft platform because the aircraft will not  sample exactly the same air parcel during the Lagrangian  experiment. The PIs also propose to obtain sufficient data to  characterize the diurnal variation of DMS and sulfur dioxide to aid  in testing chemical models of the marine boundary layer.",a9200620,Shipboard Measurements of DMS and SO2 in ASTEX,"April 1, 1992",$255422 (Estimated),Anne-Marie Schmoltner  ATM DIVISION OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES  GEO DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES,"September 30, 1996 (Estimated)",Alan R.

Ligand modified phospholipids are phospholipids to which is  covalently attached a ligand which selectively complexes to a  site on a protein molecule. Ligand modified phospholipids are  solubilized in water by hydrophobic association with nonionic  surfactants. The solubilized LMP/surfactant complex then  binds with the active site on the protein to form a protein-  phospholipid-surfactant complex. Such complexes aggregate by  virtue of hydrophobic interactions among hydrocarbon chains on  different complexes. Also another LMB/surfactant complex can  bind to the protein of a LMB/surfactant/protein complex if  there is more than one binding site on the protein.  Associations of these types lead to large complexes which  become insoluble and precipitate out of solution.   In a previous grant (CTS-8904192), the PIs demonstrated that  this precipitation does work by using DMPE-biotin as the  ligand modified phospholipid and avidin (with four binding  sites to biotin) as the protein. To solubilized the LMP, the  polyethoxy surfactant C12E8 was added in concentrations above  the CMC. The phospholipid solubilized itself into the  micelles as was inferred by changes in micellar size as  measured by quasi-elastic light scattering. When the ligand  modified phospholipid was attached to the micelles,  precipitation was not observed; however, when the solution was  diluted to presumably form sub-micelle aggregates in a  metastable, transparent solution, precipitation of the avidin  was observed. A theory for the rate of aggregate formation  was developing using Smoluchowski kinetics. Measurements of  the turbidity due to scattering were shown to be in good  agreement with the kinetic expressions. The new research  suggests examining the precipitation by this method of two  polyclonal (goat IgG) antibodies with two binding sites, anti-  biotin antibody (ABA) and anti-digoxin antibody (ADA), and a  single binding site enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK). The  synthesis routes for the LMPs are detailed. In the new  effort, the effects of impurity proteins on the affinity  precipitation will be examined, and isolation schemes to  remove the protein from the precipitating aggregate will be  devised and tested.",a9200823,Selective Precipitation of Protiens with Ligand-Modified Phospholipids,"August 1, 1992",$369628 (Estimated),CTS DIV OF CHEMICAL AND TRANSPORT SYSTEMS  ENG DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING,"January 31, 1997 (Estimated)",Peter K.

Deborah Pearsall and Dolores Piperno will collaborate on a  project to develop the application of phytolith analysis to  archaeological materials. Phytoliths are small bodies of silica  which are deposited within plants and are usually preserved in  soil after death and decomposition occurs. Although one species  of plant may produce phytoliths of many shapes, and very few  shapes are restricted to a single species, it is possible to  examine phytolith assemblages and make some species  identifications.   The research team will concentrate on corn and related species.  They will obtain phytoliths from different vegetative parts of  both domestic corn and possible confusing species to determine  what features are unique to corn phytoliths. they will also  develop an expert system to permit accurate and easy  identification.   Only under the most unusual conditions are plants remains  preserved in archaeological sites. Thus, because plants play  such an important dietary role, it is extremely difficult to  reconstruct prehistoric diets. In tropical areas of the work,  where preservation is extremely poor, this problem is  particularly acute. Phytoliths, because they are so durable,  provide a potential way around this problem and therefore merit  attention. However, because of the lack of one to one  correspondence between phytolith species, analysis poses  difficulties. This research should help to solve this problem.

It grows directly out of their  theory of levels (1978), which has influenced not only their own  work, but that of the French and Japanese schools as well. The  main direction will be to explore the deep relations between the  topology of knot complements and taut, finite depth foliations. A  major tool in this investigation will be the \"generalized Poincare-  Bendixson\" theory developed by the investigator and Cantwell as  part of the theory of levels. The lowest level of complexity is  that of a fibered knot, here called a \"depth-zero knot.\" These  knots are relatively rare, have been studied classically, and are  relatively well understood. The next level of complexity is  exhibited by the depth-one knots, which are very numerous (as shown  in David Gabai's thesis) and present many interesting questions.  Depth-one knots are currently the focus of this project, and  results already obtained confirm their interest. Other questions  to be studied relate the degree of smoothability of taut foliations  to topology. Although smoothness questions have not particularly  concerned 3-manifold topologists, a strong case can be made that  their relevance to topology is deep. In a rather different  direction, the proposer remains interested in the ergodic theory of  foliations, especially of exceptional minimal sets, and the related  question of whether the Godbillon-Vey invariant detects such  minimal sets (almost certainly not).  A foliation of a manifold is a way of filling the manifold  with lower dimensional pieces. In the case of a codimension-one  foliation, these pieces are of dimension one less than that of the  given manifold. Think of an onion or an artichoke. The topology  of a manifold is strongly related to the kind of foliation which it  will support, and in skillful hands this relation has been forged  into a powerful tool for investigating the topology of manifolds.  It is an unintuitive fact that the major algebraic tools for  investigating the topology of manifolds work best in the case of  high dimensional manifolds. The geometric tool afforded by  foliations is thus particularly welcome in the case of low  dimensional manifolds. A major instance of this is the  investigation of the complement of a knot in the three-dimensional  sphere, which turns out to be an important way to gain information  about the knot itself.",a9201723,Mathematical Sciences: Topology of Foliations and Foliated Knot Complements,"July 15, 1992",$121200 (Estimated),Ralph M.

Despite the scientific and economic benefits  which would result if year class strength could be estimated before  fish reached a marketable size, recruitment prediction has proved  to be an elusive goal.   Likely mechanisms contributing to year-to-year variations in the  year class strength of Atlantic croaker include variations in the  location and timing of spawning, the age and date of subsequent  advection to the estuarine nursery area, the duration and relative  growth rate while in the estuary, and the age and date of migration  of the estuary as an adult. In conjunction with age-structured  measures of growth and survival based on otolith daily growth  rings, this project will test these hypotheses using a new laser-  based elemental analysis technique (LS-ICPMS) to retroactively  determine the hatching site and estimate the age and date of  subsequent migrations in individual fish. The technique is based  on the acellular nature of the fish otolith (earstone), which forms  through the concentric daily additions of mineralized tissue around  a central nucleus. Given the fact that the elemental composition  of a given daily ring reflects the elemental composition of the  water which passed through the fish's gills on that same day,  migration between water masses at some age and/or date will be  recorded as a change in the elemental composition of the otolith at  the appropriate daily increment. By corollary, water mass  differences at the time and place of hatching will be reflected in  elemental composition differences in the otolith nucleus.   At present there are few (if any) markers of marine fish  populations, let alone indicators of past movement and water mass  association. Successful completion of this project has  implications not only for recruitment predication of Atlantic  croaker, but for studies of recruitment, stock structure, migration  and fisheries management around the world.",a9202937,Retrospective Determination of Atlantic Croacker Migration Through Laser-Based Elemental Analysis of Otoliths,"July 15, 1992",$290000 (Estimated),OCE DIVISION OF OCEAN SCIENCES  GEO DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES,"December 31, 1994 (Estimated)",Cynthia M.

The resources that fuel deposit feeding,  however, remain poorly identified-with a few notable exceptions.  By chemical examination and biological experimentation that isolate  the processes of food detection and digestion this project will  attempt to generalize the approach used to create a pair of those  exceptions. This project will be guided by theory that predicts  maximization of net absorption rate as material transits the gut of  an organism. The focus of the project is on three specific  processes that modulate processes leading to this maximization,  namely smell, taste and absorption across the gut wall. Smell and  taste will be determined with chemical, operational definitions  based on response to diffused or contacted compounds. The efficacy  of compounds that elicit feeding responses in the laboratory will  be tested for their roles as attractants in the field. While the  correlation between sensing ability and nutritional value will not  be perfect, the imperfection affects the ability of these animals  to sense the presence of food and so itself is of interest. The  concept of optimal gut retention times of ingested food focuses  attention on a kinetic definition of food quality, whose  determination will also likely result in identification of usable  food resources.

These specifications offer a large degree of flexibility for  electron microscopy studies and will significantly help current  research efforts as well as future projects. An integral part of  the SEM would be a Wavelength Dispersive Spectrometer (WDS) and an  Energy Dispersive X-ray Spoectrometer (EDS). These two subsystems  give elemental analysis with submicron resolution in the lateral  direction. This capability is important when studying multi-  elemental systems such as intermetallics and composite materials.  The high lateral resolution allows studies of composition variation  within individual grains and at the grain boundaries.  %%%  The Materials Science and Engineering Program at Washington  University in materials science and applied physics spans several  departments over two schools.

Acting like unsterilized  needles these insects transmit a variety of agriculturally  important plant diseases. Within the body cavity of aphids are  specialized cells which contain gram-negative bacteria  (endosymbionts) which cannot be cultured outside the host cells.  The aphid is dependent on the endosymbionts, their elimination by  treatment with antibiotics results in sterility or death of the  host. Plant sap is deficient in a variety of amino acids which  insects cannot synthesize and evidence suggests that the  endosymbionts supply these amino acids for the aphid host. Perhaps  the best available evidence is for the overproduction of tryptophan  by the endosymbiont; there is also evidence that some  endosymbionts may overproduce cysteine. Our study involves the  cloning and sequencing of genes coding for enzymes of tryptophan  and cysteine biosynthesis, the overproduction of selected key  enzymes and a study of their kinetic properties. These results may  indicate that the two key amino acids, tryptophan and cysteine are  overproduced by the endosymbiont and utilized by the aphid host.

Biochemical, immunological  and molecular-biological techniques will be used in combination  with new developments in cryofixation procedures to optimize high  resolution topography of the membranes of Gram-negative bacterial  cells. Emphasis is placed on a biochemical, structural and genetic  dissection of translocation processes involving membrane proteins  and polysaccharides as they are transported from the inner membrane  (IM) to their target site at the outer envelope membrane (OM).  Two models of translocation pathways will be tested: after  synthesis and passage through the IM, a molecule may travel either  via IM/OM connections (the membrane adhesions sites), or via the  periplasmic space. The proposed experiments are aimed at the study  of topographic relationships of the envelope components in  undisrupted cells, and at a molecular stabilization of the cell  envelope. The work will be subdivided into two aspects: 1, the  topology of export pathways of outer membrane polysaccharides and  proteins; and 2, stabilization of the membrane organization using  cryofixation and UV-flash crosslinking, to determine the in vivo  structure of adhesion sites and periplasm.

Solutions of such problems typically evolve on multiple scales,  and to be useful, numerical results need to be uniformly accurate  for the physically meaningful range of the parameters. He is  attempting to overcome these difficulties by constructing a  theory of adaptive error control based on a posteriori and a  priori error analyses. A posteriori results measure the error in  terms of the regularity of the approximation and the stability of  the solution and provide a basis for adapting the discretization.  A priori results bound the error in terms of the regularity of  the solution and the stability of the scheme and guarantee  convergence. Estep is also examining the dynamical properties of  numerical schemes in the context of producing approximations with  the correct dynamical behavior. Finally, he is studying the  implementation of adaptive error control in finite element codes  for parallel computers. The ultimate goal of this project is the  public release of a parallel code that can solve systems of  reaction-diffusion equations in two and three dimensions with  minimal user interface.  Many models in applied science result in nonlinear  reaction-diffusion differential equations that contain source  terms balanced against terms that diffuse energy. This balance is  usually delicate and difficult to handle mathematically,  consequently numerical approximation is an important tool. Yet,  solutions of such problems typically evolve on several scales,  i.e. some interesting behavior occurs in very localized regions  in space-time while other behavior evolves over long times and  over larger regions in space. The use of a uniform numerical  discretization for a real application results in huge  computations that tax even the largest computers. Estep's goal is  to produce numerical schemes that adapt themselves to the  localized behavior of the target solution so as to make the  computations both as accurate as desired and as efficient as  possible. Mathematically, he is trying to understand how to use  the information provided by an approximation to adapt the  discretization, that is, make the computations self-governing. He  is also working on the implementation of this theory into a  parallel code that solves very general problems with minimum user  input.

The first is the classical symmetric eigenvalue problem.  Recent results have shown that there is a large class of  symmetric eigenvalue problems for which small structured  perturbations result in small changes in the eigenvalues in  the relative sense. This class of matrices is called \"well-  behaved\". The problem of finding a neccessary and sufficent  condition for a matrix to be \"well-behaved\" will be  investigated.   Another concern is that only a few algorithms have been shown  to achieve relative accuracy on a subset of the set of \"well-  behaved\" matrices. The investigation will try to discover if  that set of algorithms can be expanded. The divide and  conquer approaches of Cuppen, Dongarra, Jessup, Sorensen, and  Tang are considered. Good absolute error bounds on these  algorithms have already been established and it remains to  show tighter relative error bounds for diagonal dominant  problems and for the singular value decomposition.   The other large problem area concerns the eigenvector problem  for non-symmetric matrices. The problem arises in the  numerical solution of Markov modeling problems. Accurate  general bounds on Gaussian elimination have been proven.  These allow for the straighforward application of standard  sparse matrix techniques to this problem.

The first continues work on quasiconformal  maps defined on manifolds. These maps play an essential role in  understanding transformations of Euclidean space whose local  distortions lie within fixed limits. The extension to manifolds  such as the Heisenberg group is new, providing a potentially  valuable tool in the harmonic analysis of semi-simple or  nilpotent Lie groups. In addition, the manifolds under  consideration form boundaries of strongly pseudoconvex domains in  several complex variables. It then becomes natural to ask (as  was in the real variable case) for conditions on when these  quasiconformal maps can be extended. Many of the real-variable  methods do not carry over. Nevertheless, some of the main  results do. Work will concentrate on isolating conditions which  will give the extension result.  A second line of research involving symmetric spaces  concerns domains formed by symmetric cones and tube domains. At  issue is whether or not on can obtain all symmetric tubes by a  Jordan algebra construction. If this can be done, then it is  likely that current results available for convex cones can be  carried over to the non-convex. This will have particular  implications for representation theory.  The third area of investigation will consider harmonic  functions on Riemann surfaces and on discrete structures.  Efforts will be made to carry over some of the classical one-  variable function theory to complete Riemann spaces. Of special  interest is the use of a generalized area integral which can be  defined on these spaces. Using this integral work will be done  in determining those function spaces for which the area integral  gives the same Hardy class as the traditional maximal function.",a9200463,Mathematical Sciences: Function Theory on Symmetric Spaces,"July 1, 1992",$120000 (Estimated),John V.

The research will take the form  of combined analytical, numerical and experimental  investigations. Multiple internal resonances frequently exist in  both continuous and discrete multi-degree-of-freedom systems such  as cable systems, plates, coupled beams, aerospace structures,  and mechanisms. Systems with multiple internal resonances  experimentally exhibit dangerous and complex response  characteristics under harmonic excitation, as observed in the  laboratory. Under random excitation, we will develop two modes  for stochastic bifurcation. These modes will be used to examine  the conditions under which catastrophic behavior can be presented  in terms of system parameters space and excitation spectral  density level. The analytical approach is based on the method of  stochastic averaging of the response energy envelope, with some  innovations. The advantage of this approach is that it provides  useful information pertaining to energy transfer among the  interacting modes and their stochastic bifurcation in the  neighborhood of multiple internal resonance conditions. The  validity of the analytical approach will be verified by Monte  Carlo numerical simulations and experimental tests of random  excited nonlinear models. All approaches have the common goal of  improving our understanding of the mechanisms underlying  dangerous nonlinear phenomena.

These algorithms are suitable for synchronous as well as  asynchronous routing, and apply to the buffered packet-  switching mode as well as to the unbuffered circuit-switching  mode. The algorithms are based on the idea that setting the  first column of a Clos network results in a self-routable  network. The algorithm sets the first column randomly.  Several new randomization approaches will be developed  yielding various routing algorithms of constant time control  and very small routing delay.   The performance of each of the algorithms in fault-free and  faulty Clos networks will be studied using both probabilistic  analysis and simulation. The performance metrics, measured as  a function of the switch size and the number of faulty  switches, are the number of network cycles per permutation in  synchronous routing, and the message delay and network  throughput in asynchronous routing. Performance comparisons  will be made between the algorithms to identify the best  algorithm(s), and between the buffered packet-switching mode  and the unbuffered circuit-switching mode to determine whether  the added cost of buffers is justifiable in randomized  routing.

One aspect of the problem which has received  little attention is finding data sets for which the problem is  well-posed, i.e., that the mapping from the potential to the  scattering data set is continuously invertible. This work  focuses on one such set, the so-called backscattering data. It  is the data which occurs from the restriction of the scattering  amplitude to the direction opposite to the direction of the  incident plane wave. In dimensions three and higher, the  relationship of the backscattering and potential is well  documented. In two dimensions or in cases where the data is  restricted to half-spaces, there are obstacles which will be  analyzed during the course of this project. Other work on  inverse scattering will focus on the wave equation with variable  speed of sound and the Schrodinger equation with both electric  and magnetic potential.

These actors have  improved their institutional resources and increased their campaign  activities since the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act  of 1971 and its amendments. Nevertheless, political scientists  know relatively little about how the development of these actors  has influenced their contribution stragegies in elections for the  U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.  One school of thought holds that those who invest large sums of  money in federal elections adapt gradually to their environment and  are therefore slow to change their contribution strategies. This  body of theory would predict that PACs, parties and individuals  would have difficulty departing from established patterns of  behavior, even under radically different circumstances. A second  school of thought maintains that campaign contributors are  strategic actors who constantly survey the political environment  in order to take advantage of opportunities created by political  change. This theory would predict that parties, PACs, and  individuals would rapidly adjust their contribution behavior in  response to an altered political environment.  The 1992 election cycle promises to be radically different from  those held during the last 12 years because of a confluence of  factors, including redistricting, a large number of congressional  retirements, a presidential election, and political scandals.  These factors will lead to an election cycle characterized by many  highly qualified candidates competing for a limited reservoir of  money.

Thus, one can better understand both  differences among people in social behavior and the development  of social competence in children by attending to differences in  individuals' emotional responding and regulation of emotion.  Currently there is some research both on aspects of emotional  responding (such as the tendency to experience negative emotions  and the intensity of people's emotional responses) and on self-  regulatory and coping behaviors. However, few researchers have  studied the combined effects on social outcomes of differences  among people in both emotional reactivity and the ways in which  people regulate their emotion and emotion-based behavior (e.g.,  sympathy, anger). The purpose of the present study is to examine  the relation of individual differences in tendencies to react  emotionally, emotion-regulation, and styles of coping to  vicarious emotional responding (e.g. sympathy and empathy),  social behavior (e.g., behavior when angered), popularity with  peers, and social competence at school and at home. In this  research, the PI's will take a multimethod approach, using self-  report and behavioral measures, facial reactions and  physiological measures as markers of emotion, and naturalistic  observational techniques as well as laboratory studies.  Participants in the studies are preschool and school-aged  children and adults. The goals of this research are to better  understand how people cope with emotions (especially vicariously  induced emotions such as sympathy and personal distress and  anger), the factor related to constructive coping with emotions,  and the relation of how one deals with emotions to socially  competent and positive behavior. This research will enhance our  understanding of the development of socially competent modes of  behavior and the regulation of negative emotion, and the results  could be used to foster positive social development in children.",a9208375,"Emotion, Regulation, and Social Development","September 1, 1992",$370646 (Estimated),"Steven J.

For the  first problem, the investigator plans to use the classical  analysis of elliptic partial differential equations, variational  inequalities, free boundary analysis, and some complex analysis  to establish the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of the  solutions and to provide numerical schemes for the calculation of  the solutions and the fundamental relations between the voltage  (or current) applied to the thermistor and its total resistivity,  which is essential for designing and testing thermistors. For  the interfacial dynamics problem, the investigator will use  singular perturbation methods, viscosity methods, functional  analysis, etc., to establish some physically based criteria for  the motion of the interfaces, and to provide some mathematical  justification on the uniformity between the modern models and the  classical models in solidification theory and related areas.  A thermistor is a heat sensitive electrical resistor which  has been widely used in current regulation, switching, gas  detection, control and alarms, etc. The investigator will use  mathematical tools to find relations among the characteristics of  thermistors, thereby providing guidelines for practical design  and testing.

An accurate reconstruction of this ice sheet has  significant implications for late Quaternary paleoclimatic  reconstructions, including interpreting global sea-level history.  A significant point of debate concerning the dynamics and form of  the Laurentide Ice Sheet involves specifying whether the dominant  mechanism of ice movement was internal deformation, sliding,  subglacial sediment deformation, or some combination of these.  The fundamental question is whether rigid-bed processes, such as  sliding, or soft-bed processes, particularly pervasive  deformation, were dominant. This project will attempt to answers  this question by developing aa numerical model of the ice-till  dynamics of the Lake Michigan Lobe during the last glacial  maximum. Parameters for sediment rheology derived from  geotechnical analyses of glacial sediment will form the basis of  the model, and they will be integrated with an examination of the  sediment record and sediment transport fluxes of the lobe with  respect to its dynamics. The model will test the deforming bed  versus sliding hypotheses through a quantitative assessment of  the physical conditions under which sediment deformation could or  could not have occurred beneath the Lake Michigan Lobe.  The results of this research will have significant  implications for understanding and modeling the dynamics of ice  sheets as well as for interpreting the origin of massive,  homogeneous till units in mid-latitude regions.

The  coupling of light reception to leaflet movement in the tropical  legume Samanea saman and of environmental stress to deflagellation  in the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are signal  response systems that appear to involve calcium.

In a large class of iterative methods, each  iteration consists of a solution of another system of equations.  If that system is in turn solved by an iterative method, it is  called a two-stage iterative method. Among the questions to be  investigated are criteria to determine the optimal or  near-optimal number of inner iterations to guarantee overall  convergence of the two-stage method. When a matrix is  appropriately partitioned by blocks, and its diagonal blocks are  nonsingular, many of the classical iterative methods can be  generalized to treat each submatrix as a component. On a MIMD  parallel computer (a computer that executes multiple streams of  instructions on multiple streams of data), each diagonal block  can be solved by a different processor, using components of  previous iterations as soon as they are available. These are  chaotic or asynchronous parallel block iterative methods. Their  convergence properties as well as implementation details will be  studied. Iterative methods for the solution of the general  eigenvalue problem will also be studied. Experiments with these  methods will be performed on different parallel architectures.  A large class of problems in science and enginering is  described by linear systems of equations. These are equations in  which the unknown quantities appear in a simple way. An example  of a linear system is the description of the forces on a building  structure. These forces need to be calculated to design the  building materials. The quantities to be calculated, called the  variables or unknowns, are the forces on particular points of the  structure. To describe a big structure, such as a high-rise  building or a bridge, many hundreds or thousands of equations are  needed, but because the forces on each point come only from a few  neighboring points, the equations are relatively simple. A  simple iterative method to solve such equations, that is, to find  the values of the unknowns, consists in giving an initial  approximation for the values of some unknowns, and then computing  the values of the resulting forces on the other points of the  structure. Parallel computers are simply a collection of  computers or processors that communicate with each other. In the  method just described, different processors can compute the value  of the forces on different points simultaneously, using the  information already computed by the other processors. This is  repeated until all values satisfy all equations. This situation,  if attained, is called convergence. Not all iterative methods  attain convergence. In this project, the iterative methods for  which convergence can be guaranteed will be studied. Experiments  will be carried out to test them.",a9201728,"Mathematical Sciences: Parallel, Block and Two-Stage Iterative Methods for Linear Systems","September 1, 1992",$135000 (Estimated),Deborah Lockhart  DMS DIVISION OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES  MPS DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN,"August 31, 1996 (Estimated)",Daniel B.

In the  absence of obvious barriers to gene flow such as land masses (e.g.  Isthmus of Panama) or major oceanographic boundaries (e.g. Polar  Front and Tasman Front), how does evolution proceed in large  pandemic populations in which gene flow is readily maintained over  great distances? How do chronospecies gradually evolve within one  biographic province? Most models predict that evolutionary change  in the deep-dwelling planktonic foraminifera occurs through  segregation within the water column during times of well developed  depth stratification. In broader terms, the globorotalid  morphology is believed to have evolved iteratively in association  with adaptation to increasing water depths. However, almost no  data have been have been generated to test such hypotheses.  We will isotopically analyze morphometrically-defined Late  Miocene to Recent species of the Globoratalia (Globoconella) clade  in sedimentary sequences that form a meridional transect in the  southwest Pacific. A time-series strategy will be employed  focusing upon those stratigraphic intervals in which there is  overlap in the ranges of ancestor and descendant species. Some of  the questions we will address include: Do ancestor and descendant  species exhibit consistent differences in isotopic values,  suggesting vertical or seasonal segregation in the water column?  Are there isotopic trends within  this clade, suggesting progressive habitation of cooler or warmer  waters, either vertically or seasonally? Are the isotopic trends  associated with paleoceanographic changes? Are the isotopic trends  associated with specific morphological characters? Do ancestor and  descendant species living in different water masses, some within  and some peripheral to the main biogeographic range of the clade,  exhibit similar differences in isotopic values and similar  paleoceanographic and morphological associations? How do the  stable isotopic results from the Globorotalia (Globoconella) clade  compare with those from another deep-dwelling planktonic  foraminiferal clade that, in part, exhibits similar morphologic  characteristics: - the Globorotalia (Truncorotalia) clade?",a9204857,Investigation of Evolutionary Processes in Planktonic Foraminifera Using Stable Isotopic Analysis,"July 15, 1992",$100000 (Estimated),Christopher G.

By this one understands a framework in which a  mathematical operation, applied to a certain set, can be shown to  be the restriction of another mathematical operation applied to a  larger set. In many important cases, the lifting clarifies  properties of the original operation and allows one to predict  other characteristics which were not evident in the restricted  environment. Lifting can also show how disparate theories are  parts of a larger whole.  Work on this project concerns lifting properties of bilinear  forms known as Hankel forms. Recent work established links  between Krein's method of eigenfunction expansions in the  integral representations of lifted forms to the Sz.Nagy-Foias  lifting theory of positive operators. The approach to the  research brings together the Lebesgue spaces in which the Hilbert  transform acts continuously and dilation and lifting properties  associated with scattering theory. A fundamental result  motivating this investigation is the n-conditional lifting  theorem which leads to an opportunity to attack the classical  interpolation problems in product spaces, where the main tools of  the theory of bounded analytic functions in one variable are just  not available. A second group of problems centers on the band  extension problem for matrices and related problems in control.  This work seeks to extend the one-dimensional results of Gohberg  which tell when bounded functions with prescribed negative  Fourier coefficients exist. The question addressed in this work  will be the multiparametric case, which can be phrased entirely  as a problem in lifting theory.

Clustering of equipment near the major  incoherent scatter radar (ISR) sites along the 70oW longitude line,  many of them funded by CEDAR, and the EISCAT and MU radars have  provided extremely valuable and detailed corrdinated data sets;  hence the need for a forum for the presentation of such  interdependent measurements.

According to the lending view, monetary policy  matters not only because of its effect on transactions balances,  but also because of its impact on the supply of bank loans.  Critical to the existence of a distinct lending channel is the  condition that bank loans and other forms of credit, e.g., open  market paper and trade credit, be imperfect substitutes for some  borrowers. In other words, there can only be a distinct lending  channel if some borrowers are partially \"bank dependent.\"   The contribution of this project comes from a through examination  of both the aggregate and cross-sectional implications of the  lending view. Using aggregate data, the investigators test: 1)  whether monetary policy can indeed move loan supply around; and 2)  whether these movements in loan supply in turn have meaningful  consequences for investment in capital goods and inventories. The  project uses micro data to determine whether the large inventory  swings typically seen in recessions can be attributed to monetary-  policy-induced changes in loan supply. The project determines  whether bank-dependent firms cut their inventories more sharply  than do non-bank dependent firms in the wake of a monetary  contraction. Micro data is also used to study the responsiveness  of inter-firm trade credit extensions to monetary shocks.",a9208581,"Monetary Policy, Corporate Financial Structure and Economic Fluctuations","August 15, 1992",$179795 (Estimated),"Daniel H.

The underlying theme is that recognizing  that knowledge is neither free nor infinitely costly has many  implications for the means by which individuals reallocate their  resources, including their stock of information, and for  transactions among individuals by which both goods and knowledge  are transferred.   The role of information in individual decisions is to be studied  as a basis for the still more fundamental issue of providing a  general model for economic activity. The market as understood in  standard economic theory merely approximates economic processes,  and is valid only in limiting cases where certain information costs  vanish.

The research  is motivated by decision-bound theory, which assumes there is  variability in the perceptual information associated with repeated  presentations of every object or event. The theory assumes that  the perceptual information obtained from any one presentation can  be described by a set of coordinate values along each of the  relevant perceptual dimensions. When learning to identify  unfamiliar objects or events or when learning new categories,  humans are assumed to construct decision boundaries that partition  the perceptual space into regions. Each region is associated with  an object or event name or with the name of a category. When a new  object is encountered, the person determines in which region the  percept has fallen and then identifies or categorizes the object by  the name associated with that region.   This research will consist of four projects. The first will  measure the distribution of information available in a visually-  presented stimulus along the experimenter-defined stimulus  dimensions. The second will test for possible interactions between  different functional units in the visual cortex. When incorporated  into decision-bound theory, the results of these two projects might  be used to construct machines that identify or categorize visual  stimuli as well as do humans.

Our  current theoretical understanding of internal solitary-wave  dynamics is based, to a large extent, on weakly nonlinear long-  wave theories which are derived on the assumption that only long  waves are present. On the other hand, there is evidence from  laboratory and field observations that, in general, large-  amplitude solitary internal waves do not remain locally confined  as suggested by these approximate theories, but, rather, they  develop short-wavelength oscillatory tails that cause radiation  damping. This radiation, in turn, provides a nonlinear  mechanism for coupling large-amplitude solitary-wave  disturbances with short-scale oscillatory waves of different  modes. For example, it is possible for solitary internal waves  to transfer energy to short-scale surface waves that remain  phase-locked with the internal waves P a situation reminiscent of  the surface rips that often accompany internal waves in the  field, and are visible in radar images of the sea surface.  In order to fill the gap currently existing in our  theoretical understanding, this research program investigates  the generation of oscillatory tails and the related radiation-  dampling mechanism of solitary internal waves, using singular-  perturbation and numerical methods. Particular emphasis is  placed on calculating the amplitude of short-wave tails under  realistic conditions, including the possibility of deep fluids  and the presence of a free surface. For this purpose, a  nonlinear WKB technique will be developed for weakly nonlinear  disturbances, and fully numerical computations will be carried  out for large-amplitude solitary waves. In addition, the  transfer of energy from solitary waves to small-scale  disturbances of different modes (short-scale surface or lower-  mode internal waves) will be examined in comparison with other  physical processes, like viscous dissipation, that occur in  practice.",a9202064,Mathematical Sciences: Nonlinear Coupling of Solitary Internal Waves With Small- Scale Disturbances,"September 1, 1992",$137600 (Estimated),DMS DIVISION OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES  MPS DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN,"February 28, 1995 (Estimated)",Triantaphyllos R.

This  research will concentrate on large-scale problems, direct treatment  of sparse linear and nonlinear constraints, and the guarantee of  superlinear convergence. The research on SQP methods will extend  techniques based on linearly constrained subproblems and an  augmented Largrangian merit function. Topics to be considered  include use of a reduced Hessian, use of exact second derivatives,  strategies for accepting inexact solutions of subproblems, and  techniques for treating infeasible subproblems.  Work in barrier methods has already proved remarkably  successful for linear programs. Much research remains to improve  their reliability and to extend their application to large-scale  nonlinear (and convex) problems.

A group of small hydrophobic proteins has  recently been described in filamentous fungi. These proteins,  termed hydrophobins, have a number of properties in common,  including: 1) accumulation on surfaces of sporulation  structures, 2) accumulation on aerial hyphae, 3) presence of  eight cysteines in the molecule, 4) putative hydrophobic leader  sequences, and 5) hydrophobic domains in the secreted protein.  Proteins, or genes encoding such proteins, have been described  from a number of different unrelated filamentous fungi, including  one from the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica.  This small hydrophobic protein, cryparin, was discovered because  it is down-regulated in strains which are hypovirulent and  sporulate poorly. Cryparin accumulates on asexual fruiting  bodies and in aerial hyphae. Unlike other hydrophobins, cryparin  is also a lectin. The evolutionary conservation in different  fungi of similar small cell surface hydrophobic proteins  associated with fruiting bodies suggests that they play important  roles in the biology of these fungi. This proposal is to  investigate the role of cryparin in the biology of the chestnut  blight fungus. The physical properties of cryparin at air  interfaces may be important for some aspect of fruiting body  formation, positioning of the fruiting body, or spore dispersal.  Cryparin could also play a role in virulence as proposed for  another hydrophobin. To begin addressing the role of cryparin in  the biology of the chestnut blight fungus.  %%%   The chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitics, has  nearly eliminated the American chestnut from its original natural  range. Before this disease killed them chestnut trees were one  of the most important and common trees in the forests that range  from New England to the Southern Appalachians. A biological  control for this disease has been discovered. A virus infects  the chestnut blight fungus causing it to no longer be able to  attack the chestnut tree or to form normal fungal reproductive  structures. We have found in previous work that the virus  interferes with production of a few specific fungal proteins, one  of which is the protein cryparin. We have preliminary evidence  that this protein may play a role in the ability of the fungus to  reproduce. There is also a possibility that the protein enhances  the ability of fungus to damage infected trees. It is the  purpose of the study to investigate what role this abundantly  produced protein plays in the biology of the fungus.

Power system stability characteristics  generally restrict the maximum allowable power  transfers at thermal limits of the lines. The stability  characteristics of power systems depend on  damping devices and damping control strategies  employed. While there are many devices that can  be used in power systems to achieve damping, the  strategies that are currently used to control these  devices generally do not provide enough stability  enhancement to enable operation near thermal  limits. The development of better damping control  strategies for large power systems is the focus of  this research.

Specific projects are developed  around the theme of computer-intensive statistical inference.  Special topics include bootstrap, jackknife and related  resampling methods, permutation tests and group theoretic testing  procedures, Gibbs sampling and Markov chains. All these topics  concern data mappings of special interest to statisticians.  Historically, permutations were the first such mappings studied.  Methods like the bootstrap generalize permutations to wider  classes of statistical problems, at the expense of less  mathematical neatness and greater computational expense. This  project addresses ways to overcome these obstacles.  Statistical inference is the science of generalization from  observed data, often just a small amount, to the larger  population from which the data were drawn. The basic principles  of statistical inference were laid down before World War II. The  basic theory was built around classical mathematics and the bell-  shaped curve. Computer-intensive methods, developed in the last  15 years, aim to extend the range, ease, and plausibility of  statistical arguments. They substitute specially-developed  computer algorithms of classical mathematical approximations  relating to the bell-shaped curve. Our research aims to justify  these algorithms.

The focus of this project  is a thick macroalgal canopy that carpets the bottom of Waquoit  Bay, a eutrophic embayment on Cape Cod, MA. The macroalgal canopy  frequently exceeds a thickness of 15 cm. Within the upper third of  the dense mat, O2 concentrations are high during the day due to  photosynthesis and NH4+ concentrations are low (several uM). In  contrast, the lower portion of the canopy is anaerobic even during  the day and NH4+ concentrations are very high (hundreds of uM).  Therefore, within a zone about 5 cm from the algal surface  conditions are favorable for nitrification with sufficient O2 from  photosynthesis and diffusion from above and NH4+ diffusing from  below. It is hypothesized that high rates of denitrification may  occur at the high NH+4/low O2 interface within the algal canopy due  to the existence of denitrification-nitrification coupling in this  zone. The hypothesized interaction is in fact a triple coupling of  photosynthesis-nitrification-denitrification. This hypothesis will  be examined in a series of experiments to be conducted at the  Marine Biological Lab in Woods Hole, MA, a facility close by to  Waquoit Bay.

Specifically, the proposed  research will investigate the neural substrates of postnatal  olfactory learning in newborn vertebrates. This early learning is  associated with specific changes in neural structure and function  in the olfactory bulb, the first central relay for olfactory  information processing. Dr. Wilson's previous work has  demonstrated the output neurons in the olfactory bulb,  mitral/tufted cells, modify their response patterns to odors  learned during the early postnatal period. Furthermore, Dr. Wilson  has found that mitral/tufted cells receive convergent information  about both odor stimuli and reward stimuli. Importantly, both the  behavioral and neural consequences of early learning are  morepinephrine dependent, as is at least one component of  mitral/tufted cell response to reward. The proposed experiments  will examine how mitral/tufted cells are modified during olfactory  associative learning and uses a combination of neurophysiological  and neuropharmacological techniques to further explore the neural  substrates of the descending reward input to the olfactory bulb.  Based on his preliminary data, a specific circuit is proposed for  convergence of odor and reward information in the bulb involving  the primary olfactory nerve and norepinephrine centrifugal inputs  to the bulb. Norepinephrine agonists and antagonists will be  infused into the olfactory bulb during odor-reward associative  conditioning.

Ideally this circulation should be simulated with a fully three  dimensional model, but to do so can be computationally prohibitive.  For this reason, and also in order to isolate certain processes for  in-depth studies, researchers rely on simpler models for much of  their work. In designing simpler models, researchers endeavor to  make them as realistic as possible. Under her last award, the  principal investigator coupled a quasi-geostrophic time-dependent  wave model to a zonally averaged (two-dimensional) chemical-  radiative-dynamical model of the middle atmosphere (principally the  stratosphere). The wave model is used to determine the driving of  the mean flow by Rossby waves and subsequently the eddy transport  of chemical species. Her goal was to obtain more realistic  simulations of stratospheric circulation and associated trace  species transport than would be possible with the two dimensional  model alone.  With this renewal award, Dr. Smith will continue her research  on the middle atmosphere. The coupled model will be made more  realistic with the addition of an interactive lower boundary at the  tropopause. The principal objective then will be to assess the  quality of the coupled model's dynamical interactions and the  ability to simulate transport of chemical species (the distribution  of which also affects the circulation). The coupled model will be  compared in detail with a fully nonlinear three dimensional model  of the stratosphere to determine the ability of the wave model to  represent transport processes.",a9205027,A Coupled Model of the Effects of Planetary Waves on the Zonally Averaged State of the Middle Atmosphere,"June 15, 1992",$137779 (Estimated),Pamela L.

This defense is centered on the 4 enzymes  of the ascorbate-glutathione pathway in wich H2O2 is scavenged.  Biochemical studies will concentrate on glutathione reductase.  This enzyme will be purified and characterized with regard to amino  acid sequence, kinetic properties, pH optimum, inhibitor effects,  cofactor requirements, substrate specificity, pI values, and  possible isozymes. Polyclonal antibodies will be used to  immunologically characterize the enzyme and to determine the  subcellular location with electron microscopy.   A major component of the proposed work consists of molecular  studies to 1) identify the biochemical mechanisms that regulate the  genes encoding glutathione reductase and ascorbate peroxidase and  2) describe environomental and developmental factors that affect  regulation. The genes for glutathione reductase and ascorbate  peroxidase will be cloned in order to identify regulatory sites and  study cis- and trans-acting factors involved in express. The  regulatory role of various environmental factors (water stress,  heat and chilling shock, pO2) and of potential biochemical  effectors (GSH, H2O2, paraquat, rhizobiol signals) will be  examined.

These strata also form part of the  standard reference section of the North American Ordovician time  scale as well as the reference standard for the conodont and  graptolite biozonations commonly used for temporal correlation in  this interval. The goal of the research is to employ geochemical  fingerprinting of unaltered phenocrysts within the K-bentonites  together with new and detailed studies of the ranges of graptolite  and conodont species to integrate these separate stratigraphies  into a unified chronostratigraphic network.  We propose to accomplish this by 1) establishing precise ties  between the graptolite zones and the North Atlantic and  midcontinent conodont zones based on detailed collecting of range  data from numerous measured sections that each span the facies  transition from Trenton Group carbonates into the Utica Shale and  2) establishing precise ties between the laterally equivalent  siliciclastic and carbonate facies based on the identification of  synchronous time planes through geochemical fingerprinting of the  K-bentonites. The techniques to be employed for K-bentonite  correlation include analysis of 1) major and trace element  composition of melt inclusions within quartz phenocrysts.  Additionally, we propose to use high precision U-Pb zircon  geochronometry to calibrate our chronostratigraphy.  The resulting chronostratigraphy will provide a temporal  framework, calibrated in years, that will provide a direct test of  the accuracy of the existing graptolite and conodont  biostratigraphies as well as sequence stratigraphic and  coenocorrelation studies of these rocks.

The original  motivation comes from the need for analytical  redundant management of control elements  (e.g.actuators) in the event of hardware failures in  high reliability systems. One such example is  modern combat aircraft subjected to  actuator/surface impairments. A major task is to  achieve reconfigurable control designs balancing  impairment detectability and sufficient robustness.  This involves careful selection of types and  parameters of the controllers and the impairment  detecting filters used. Algorithms are proposed to  make such selection systematic. A further  investigation is focused on enhancing the speed and  accuracy of the failure detection and isolation FDI  unit.

The superposition of  sequence and structural information will allow an understanding  of how the hypervariable regions of the molecule define species  specificity while the highly conserved regions confer common  function to all lysins, which is dissolution of the vitelline  envelope surrounding the egg. At the same time, the modeling  analysis will be used to design site-directed mutants, which can  be assayed for biological activity by V.D. Vacquier, to test the  structural hypothesis. Crystallization experiments with the  lysins from the other species, and the mutant lysins, will be  carried out, in order to obtain additional crystal structures to  support or correct the structures observed by homology modeling.  %%%  The significance of this project pertains to the molecular events  which take place during fertilization. The molecule being  studied, sperm lysin, is responsible for dissolving a hole in the  membrane surrounding the egg so that the sperm can penetrate this  membrane. The species being studied, abalone, offers  experimental advantages in isolating the protein components for  both the sperm and egg. By solving the three-dimensional  structure of lysin, we can infer how the protein functions. No  structure of a protein involved in fertilization has ever been  solved. V. D. Vacquier, who provides samples of lysin, has  primary sequences for lysins from seven abalone species. The  sequences show regions of extreme variability and contrasting  regions of absolute conservation. Once we know the structure of  one lysin we can map the sequence data onto the structure.

The project consists of three parts.   The first one will develop a model of a city composed of several  communities, formalizing the links between residential choice,  skills acquisition, and overall productivity. It will show how  local externalities in human capital investment induce self-  segregation by occupation, and how this affects the composition of  the labor force. In particular it can lead other areas to drop out  of the labor force and become unproductive \"ghettos.\" The analysis  will show that underemployment is more extensive, the easier it is  for high-skilled workers to isolate themselves from others, but  that at the same time their attempts to do so may be self-  defeating.   The second part will extend the analysis to two other issues  concerning the structure and productivity of cities. The first is  the value of local diversity in land uses and its tendency to self-  destruct under market pressures. The second is the recent exodus  of firms, hence jobs and taxes, out of central cities into suburbs,  and its implications for employment and income distribution.   The third part will study the implications of group formation for  long term macroeconomic growth. It will add to recent models of  endogenous growth by recognizing that individuals can choose the  group from which they receive human capital spillovers (school,  neighborhood, city, state), although at a price: land and other  rents on non-reproducible factors reflect the quality of the  externality which group membership confers.",a9209267,"Human Capital, Social Partitions, Cities and Growth","July 1, 1992",$67849 (Estimated),"Vincy Fon  SES DIVN OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCES  SBE DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","December 31, 1994 (Estimated)",Roland J.

The system  being studied is the induction of plant defense responses,  phytoalexin accumulation in soybean (Glycine max) induced by  oligosaccharides (elicitors) originating from the mycelial wall of  a phytopathogenic fungus, Phytophthora megasperma f. sp. glycinea.  Considerable information has been obtained about the structure of  an elicitor (a branched hepta-beta-glucoside) derived from mycelial  wall glucans and about the identity and regulation of elicitor-  induced genes encoding enzymes required for the biosynthesis of the  phytoalexins. However, little is known about the mechanisms by  which plant cells perceive the elicitor, or how that signal is  transmitted to the cell nucleus to initiate changes in gene  expression. The research described in this proposal focuses on the  first step in the elicitor-stimulated signal transduction pathway,  that is, the recognition of a hepta-beta-glucoside elicitor by a  plasma-membrane localized receptor. The proposed research has  three major goals. The first goal is the identification,  purification, and characterization of hepta-beta-glucoside elicitor  binding protein(s) (EBPs) from soybean root microsomal membranes.  Evidence has already been obtained that a single class of specific,  high-affinity (dissociation constant of 1 nM) EBPs exist in soybean  root microsomes originating from the plasma membrane. These EBPs  have been successfully solubilized from the membranes using  detergents, and the solubilized EBPs retain their high affinity and  specificity for the elicitor. The number and identity of the  proteins that have hepta-beta-glucoside elicitor binding activity  will be established by photo-affinity labeling. The EBPs will be  purified by affinity chromatography and antibodies against the  binding protein(s) will be prepared. The second goal is the  isolation and characterization of cDNA sequences that encode EBPs.  Clones carrying EPB sequences will be identified by screening cDNA  expression libraries with radiolabeled hepta-beta-glucoside  elicitor. Alternatively, partial protein sequences obtained from  the purified EBPs will be used to prepare synthetic nucleic acid  probes with which to screen cDNA libraries. These clones and their  derived sequences will be used to identify possible structural and  functional domains in the EBPs that might relate to their role in  signal transduction. The third goal, which will be undertaken if  time permits, is to demonstrate that the EBPs identified in these  studies are physiological receptor(s) for the elicitor. Sequence  comparisons and expression of truncated EBP genes will be used to  identify and delineate functional domains of the EBPs. Transgenic  expression of wild-type and mutant EBPs in plant cells that do not  contain endogenous EBPs, tissue-specific localization of EBPs in  relation to localization of plant defense responses, and  determination of the effect of anti-sense EPB sequences on the  expression of hepta-beta-glucoside-induced plant defense responses  will be undertaken to demonstrate the physiological significance of  the EBPs in elicitor-mediated signal transduction.  %%%  The long term goal of this research is to understand how plant  cells perceive and respond to extracellular signals. The system  being studied is the induction of a defense response in soybean  plants. The defense response is triggered by exposure of the plant  to certain carbohydrates (elicitors) which originate from the  filament wall of a pathogenic fungus which specifically infects the  soybean. In response to the elicitors the soybean plant  synthesizes and accumulates protective chemicals known as  phytoalexins. The more immediate goals of this project are to  identify and characterize the plant receptors for the elicitors.  Detailed characterization of the elicitor receptor will be an  important step toward understanding of the signal transduction  pathway by which plants detect and respond to pathogens.",a9206882,Purification and Cloning of Elicitor Binding Protein(s) from Soybean,"February 15, 1993",$547041 (Estimated),Barbara K.

He will analyze  archaeological materials excavated at the site of Cueva Manachaki  which is located in the \"cloud forest\" region of Eastern Peru.  This area lies at a middle altitude and separates the high open  Andean grasslands from the low lying tropical Amazon rainforest.  The site itself is a small rock shelter which contains finely  stratified deposits which span the per-ceramic through ceramic  periods. Excavation has yielded not only large quantities of  ceramic and lithic materials but also well preserved organic  remains. Mr Church and his colleagues will analyze these  materials to accomplish three goals: 1. to determine the cultural  sequence for this little known region; 2. to test the hypothesis  of long-term cultural development and subsequent evaluation of  the alternative migration hypotheses through analysis of  continuity and change in the cultural sequence; and 3. to  identify and interpret evidence for highland-lowland rainforest  interaction.   Peru is of great archaeological interest for several reasons. It  saw the rise of a series of complex state level societies before  arrival of the Spanish. The region is also characterized by  strong vertical zonation where the steep rise of the Andes  creates a number of distinct ecological zones in close proximity.  Many models have been developed which link the development of  complex societies to the need to coordinate the movement of  subsistence goods across zones. While extensive excavations have  provided excellent data bases for some regions, others including  the cloud forest are little understood. Mr. Church hypothesizes  that local adaption took place within this zone and that it  served as more than a way station between highlands and lowlands.  Analysis of materials from the unique site of Cueva Manachaki  will allow him to evaluate this idea.   This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists.

These evaluations are predicted to occur when critical attributes  of a social stimulus that control judgment (e.g., stimatizing  attibutes such as gender, race, SES) are not at the respondent's  focus of attention. In Part 1, a procedure will be used in which  the attribute of fame is incorrectly assigned as a result of a  bias in memory caused by perceptual familiarity.

This  basin consists of a sequence of sedimentary layers ranging in age  from Jurassic to recent. Generally, there exist three different  flow regimes in this basin, a shallow fresh-water system, and two  deeper systems, one hydropressured, one geopressured, which are  characterized by fluids with higher concentrations of solutes.  Although the depositional sequence of the sedimentary formations  in this basin is well undeerstood, the relation of the brines to  their host formations is often not clear. The geochemical  characteristics of iodine combined with the half-life of 129 I  (15.7 Ma) make this isotope system potentially useful for the  determination of source ages for fluids and orgainic material in  this basin and, in conjunction with determination of 36 Cl, for the  estimate of residence times of waters in their respective host  formaiton. The results of this study will give information on the  age relation between the fluids and their host rocks, on the  relation between fluids in the different parts of the basin and on  communication between different reservoirs. Because the presence  of iodine is related to that of organic material the result will  given information on the origin and the age relation of  hydrocarbons in this basin. Since this project represents the  first time that this isotope system is to be used on a regional  scale in a sedimentary basin, the study will also indicate to what  extent the 129 I system is useful for the investigation of fluid  movement in basins containing organic material.

Davis' main emphasis is the use of surgery theory to study rational  information in manifold theory. Surgery theory is the main tool  for classification of manifolds of dimension greater than 3,  although complexities in homotopy and integral representation  theory make it efficacious only in special cases. However, if one  works over the rational numbers, complete results are available for  manifolds with finite fundamental group. Davis will attempt  extensions of these results to manifolds with infinite fundamental  group, and to spaces more general than manifolds, but which still  possess some form of duality. A second and quite different  direction of Davis' research is knot theory. He will study the  homology of covers of the 3-sphere branched over a knot, the set of  periods of a knot, and their relationship with algebraic number  theory. In related work, Kent E. Orr will continue to study  linking and knotting phenomena in codimension two, as well as  investigate the implications of the recent Cochran-Orr work to  Casson-Gordon invariants and four-dimensional surgery. Among other  things, he hopes to answer the following two questions about the  link slice problem: Are all even-dimensional links slice? Do the  presently known homotopy theoretic linking invariants of links in  the 3-sphere (such as the transfinite invariants of Levine and Orr  and the Le Dimet invariant) reduce to classically defined  invariants such as Milnor's invariants and Massy products?  The details of these parts vary, but all are concerned with  reducing geometric information to a subject for calculation or to  perfecting the algebraic machinery used for the calculations. The  nature of the geometric information involved is the crux of the  difficulty. While questions about lengths, areas, angles, volumes,  and so forth virtually cry out to be reduced to calculations, it is  far different with what are known as topological properties of  geometric objects. These are properties such as connectedness  (being all in one piece), knottedness, having no holes, and so  forth. All systematic study of such properties, for example, how  to tell whether two geometric objects really differ in respect to  one of these properties or are only superficially different, or how  to classify the variety of differences that can occur, all these  have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they have been  reduced to matters of calculation, and two of the principal tools  for this are homotopy theory and surgery theory.",a9208052,Mathematical Sciences: Algebraic and Geometric Topology,"September 1, 1992",$128400 (Estimated),Ralph M.

Part I of the  research, the first of two parts, focuses on a biaxial  constitutive test with two additional, innovative, features: (i)  the capacity to continuously measure the speed of sound in  deforming granular material as a function of the accummulated  deformation in the sample and the direction of propagation of the  waves and (ii) the capacity of continuously measure density  changes and particle velocities with sophisticated X-ray imaging  equipment. The goals of Part I include (i) experimentally, to  construct and operate the apparatus and (ii) computationally, to  simulate deformation of a sample in the apparatus, including  superimposed acoustic waves, up to and beyond the formation of  shear bands. Mathematical analysis has a major supporting role  to play in extracting constitutive information from the  experimental data and in developing an appropriate numerical  scheme.  Part II of the research consists of several subprojects  which probe more deeply phenomena discovered in the previous  grant period. These include (i) to study the flutter instability  as a possible cause of vibrations in silos, (ii) to further  investigate experimentally and to understand analytically  porosity waves in a discharging silo, (iii) to characterize more  fully and to explain the power spectra of time-dependent stresses  in a discharging silo, and (iv) to explore \"scale-invariant\"  initial value problems as a possible paradigm problem in  elastoplasticity (analogous to the Riemann problem in gas  dynamics).

Emphasis  will be on the study of the existence question for classes of  equations, in particular, the existence of periodic solutions,  and the study of a priori regularity and other properties of the  evolution. The work is limited to three objectives. First, in  the area of infinite dimensional dynamical systems and KAM  theory, continuing research will be done in extending techniques  of Hamiltonian perturbation applied to the wave equation to other  equations and to investigate methods related to studies in higher  space dimensions. The second direction involves smoothing  properties of dispersive equations. It has been known for some  time that solutions of dispersive evolution equations can be  smoother than their initial conditions. But their quadratic  norms can grow unbounded without cut-off restrictions in spatial  directions. Work will be done to isolate the parts of the  equations which contribute to the growth and try to develop  estimates on the norm size. The final part of the project  studies waves in free surfaces and interfaces. The problem,  known as Stokes conjecture, concerns the solitary wave of  extremal form. Such waves are known to be analytic except at  their crest. It is the object of this study to show (i) that a  Lipschitz singularity of interior angle 120 degrees must occur at  the crest and (ii) that the extremal wave profile is monotone  decreasing and convex on either side.  Partial differential equations form the backbone of  mathematical modeling in the physical sciences. Phenomena which  involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials  and energy are known to obey certain general laws expressible in  terms of the interactions and relationships between partial  derivatives.

While the key role of accurate and timely demand  forecasting in planning production, inventories and work force,  and economic lot sizing has received considerable attention, the  vast majority of forecasting research, and nearly all commercial  forecasting software, assume that demand is \"smooth\" rather than  intermittent. Results of the Phase I Small Business Innovation  Research (SBIR) study establish the technical basis for a new  software tool that can be used to forecast intermittent demand  and that is suitable for use on a desktop computer. The  objectives of the Phase II research focus on (1) gathering and  analysis of more real-world intermittent time-series data; (2)  implementation of a single-series method of Croston's for  forecasting intermittent demand, including its extension to  trending and seasonal data; (3) development of a new multi-  series forecasting approach based on stochastic process models  that \"borrow strength\" across the items in a product line; (4)  determination of the most effective use of sales-force judgments  of intermittent demand, including their combination with  statistical forecasts' and (5) integration of the forecasting  methods developed in Phase II, culminating in their  implementation in a software prototype running on desktop  computers.

The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the  use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.   This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit  by Dr. John P. Svaren to go to the University of Munich to work  with Dr. Wolfram Horz. Their project is designed to explore the  ability of eukaryotic trans-activators to modulate chromatin  structure. Numerous in vitro studies have shown that nucleosomes  can block binding of critical transcription factors to a DNA  template. In addition, the promoters of most actively transcribing  genes appear to be at least partially nucleosome-free. Therefore,  since virtually all eukaryotic DNA is normally packaged into  nucleosomes, there must be some mechanism to keep nucleosomes  from occupying critical promoter elements of active genes. Study  of the PHO5 gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae should  give more insight into this process. Upon induction of PHO5  transcription (by phosphate starvation), four nucleosomes are  removed from the promoter region. Several experiments by Dr.  Wolfram Horz's lab suggest that the trans-activator, PHO4, is  responsible for triggering the nucleosome loss. Drs. Svaren and  Horz's project is designed to map the protein domain of PHO4 that  is involved in nucleosome dissolution. In particular, the acidic  domain of PHO4 will be investigated to see whether it is necessary  or sufficient for this transformation.

The survival of a diverse group of environmentally important  organisms, including myxobacteria, cytophaga, cyanobacteria, and  Beggiotoa, depends upon their ability to glide. In this project,  Myxococcus xanthus will be used as a model to understand gliding  because it is genetically well-characterized. One gene, mglA, is  essential for gliding; the focus of this project will be on how  MglA protein interacts with other motility components. Since mglA  is the only gene common to the two known genetically-identified  systems, A and S, that control gliding, MglA protein may affect  expression of A- and S-gliding genes. The first aim will therefore  be to isolate and characterize reporter gene (lacZ) insertions in  A- and S-motility genes and determine if their transcription is  altered in an mgl- strain. Another goal will be to use mutagenesis  to probe the functional domains of MglA by identifying mglA mutants  that show aberrant gliding. Suppressor experiments have also been  designed to identify genes encoding proteins that interact with  MglA. One mutant has already been identified that suppresses the  mglA defect, and the corresponding gene will be cloned to determine  if it encodes a gliding protein that interacts with MglA.  %%%  Bacteria need to be able to move from one place to another in order  to survive. One of the most intriguing, and least understood,  mechanisms of bacterial motility is the phenomenon of gliding on  solid substrata. The field is complicated by the likelihood that  the gliding mechanisms employed by one group of gliding bacteria  may not be the same as those employed by other groups. In  myxobacteria, gliding is crucial not only to enable the bacteria to  find food, but also to enable the bacteria to undergo a  developmental transition from the vegetative gliding bacterium form  to a sporogenic \"fruiting body.\" There are two almost independent  motility systems, termed \"A\" (\"adventurous\") and \"S\" (\"social\").  S-motility requires cell-to-cell proximity for movement to occur,  and is known to involve at least 12 distinct genes. A-motility  does not require cell-cell contact, and is controlled by at least  22 genes. Wild-type myxococci exhibit both A+ and S+ motility. A  mutation in one of the A or S genes abolishes only the A or S type  of motility. Both of these mechanisms seem to involve regulation  of the same basic motility machinery. In addition, there are other  genes, termed \"frz\" genes, which affect the rate at which cells  reverse direction while gliding. However, there is a single  genetic locus, mglA, for which a mutation abolishes both A and S  type motility, resulting in totally nonmotile bacteria. The  proposed studies of this pivotal gene are likely to shed new light  on the mechanism of gliding in myxococci.",a9206996,Function of Mg1 Proteins in Gliding in Myxococcus,"July 15, 1992",$180000 (Estimated),Eve Ida Barak  MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"June 30, 1996 (Estimated)",Patricia L.

The properties of  sequence boundaries, and the geometry and stacking of sequence  elements (\"systems tracts\") in such ramp settings are highly  controversial and very few published examples are well constrained.  This project is an integrated study of sequence geometry in ramp  settings. The project will consist of conceptual and numerical  modeling accompanied by rigorous field testing in one of the best  exposed successions of clastic ramp sequences in the world: the  Upper Cretaceous marginal marine deposits of the San Juan basin,  New Mexico. The primary objectives of this project are to (1)  identify, evaluate and map stratigraphic surfaces, which meet such  objective criteria for a sequence boundary as downward shift in  onlap and subaerial exposure of older marine strata, (2) test the  concepts of instantaneous versus diachronous formation of sequence  boundaries, (3) document stacking patterns and volumetric  partitioning of sediment between different elements (systems  tracts) of the sequences, (4) forward model variations in sequence  geometry in response to different rates of tectonic subsidence,  rates and amplitudes of sea level change, and sediment supply.  Two-dimensional, flexural backstripping will be applied to  reconstruct the geometry of the depositional surfaces through time.  The modeling will be based on a combination of two numerical  methods.

Present  criteria for evaluating indigeneity has focused on a bulk organic  fraction derived from fossils and includes analysis of amino acid  abundances and enantiomers and comparison of the 13C and 15N  values of the fossil material to those of the modern organism.  These criteria incorporate two assumptions that 1) the bulk organic  material is homogeneous and 2) the relative abundance of amino  acids and the isotopic compositions are comparable to a modern  analog. The difficulties with these assumptions are that the bulk  material is not homogeneous but rather composed of several  different proteins and the organic matrix of fossils may be  altered. If the diagenetic product obtained from a fossil is a  consequence of differential loss or retention of specific protein  fractions then the geochemical characteristics and interpretation  of the data are entirely a function of the protein composition of  the organic matrix. Therefore, more precise and new methods are  needed to assess the effects of diagenesis and derive criteria for  indigeneity. A better understanding of changes in the organic  fraction of fossil material over time must include 1) an evaluation  of variation in the relative contributions of each of the protein  fractions over time, 2) an understanding of the alterations that  occur in the biochemical characteristics of individual protein  fractions during diagenesis and 3) new molecular level approaches,  such as evaluation of the 13C of individual amino acid enantiomers  (see Justification of explanation).

Recently the use of small area estimation has been increasing  in survey sampling. Agencies of the Federal Government have been  involved in obtaining estimates of unemployment rates, per capita  income, crop yields, and so forth, for state and local  government areas. In typical instances, only a few samples are  available from an individual area, and an estimate of a certain  area mean, or simultaneous estimates of several area means, can  be improved by incorporating information from similar neighboring  areas.   Empirical and hierarchical Bayes methods are particularly  well-suited to meet this need of \"borrowing strength\" from related  small areas. The principal investigator, over the years, has  developed general univariate Bayesian methods with applications to  small area estimation. The present research is concerned with the  extension of such methods to multivariate small area estimation  problems and with the analysis of repeated survey data, which  amounts to time series analysis. Specific applications will be  made to the study of undercount adjustment in the 1990 census,  estimation of median incomes of three-, four-, and five-person  families as needed by the Department of Health and Human Services,  and the estimation of all employee totals in non-agricultural  industrial establishments as needed by the Bureau of Labor  Statistics.

Advances in nonlinear control theory will  substantially improve the design of control systems  for light-weighted robot arms, for autopilots and  guidance systems of highly maneuverable aircrafts,  increase the flexibility and energy efficiency in the  regulation of chemical plants, facilitate the real-time  reconfiguration of a control system after the  occurrence of a failure. Among the many problems  which must be confronted, a most important one is  the desing of feedback laws achieving tracking of  prescribed exogenous commands and rejection of  exogenous disturbances. The approaches to the  problem of tracking/rejection of exogenous inputs  in a control system depend upon the model chosen  to describe the family of exogenous inputs which  are expected to affect the system. If no model is  available, an appealing strategy -which revealed  itself very powerful and attractive in the case of  linear systems- is to base the design on the worst  possible situation. For instance, in the frequency  domain, the feedback laws are designed so as to  minimize the maximal amplitude of the frequency  response to the exogenous inputs.

Such capabilities are  needed to remain competitive in the engineering and construction  marketplace with the growing need for multi-disciplinary analyses  and simulations, design-for- construction and -manufacturing, and  the integration of analysis, design, and decision-support tools.  To enable integration and reuse, software components must be  characterized by their functional properties, i.e., a description  of the services they provide. Otherwise, one can only examine the  program text itself, attempt to characterize its behavior, and try  putting the pieces together. Even object-oriented languages are  inadequate for promoting integration since they cannot be used to  state what a component does, only how it is implemented.  Declarative descriptions of functional properties offer the  potential to characterize the interaction of complex software  components and systems, thus enabling software integration and  reuse.

They can therefore be used in designed  structures which typically require metals. Other polymer  blends have special properties that permit them to be used for   particular applications. Most blends are made by mixing two  or more immiscible polymers in the molten state. Their  multiphase structure must be stabilized to prevent coalescence   when the blend is extruded or molded by a polymer processor.   The main method for compatibilization is to use a block  copolymer which can act like a polymeric soap to stabilize the   morphology.

First, writing parallel programs by hand is very  difficult. The programmer must manage communication,  synchronization, and scheduling of tens to thousands of  independent processes. The burden of correctly managing the  environment often overwhelms programmers. Second, once  implemented on a particular MIMD architecture, the resulting  codes are usually not usable on other MIMD architectures,  necessitating a substantial effort to port. This discourages  users from parallelizing their code, since new architectures are  introduced so frequently. Third, there is no software support  for transparently executing applications on heterogeneous \"meta-  systems\" comprised of a variety of high-performance  architectures.

Until recently,  however, there have been no methods available that would allow  determination of instantaneous growth rates of fungi in any  environment. Consequently, quantitative data concerning fungal  production or flow of energy through the fungal community are not  available. A method for estimating instantaneous growth rates of  natural fungal communities by determining rates of incorporation  of 14C-acetate into ergosterol was recently described. The  proposed studies are designed to adapt and evaluate this method for  use on the leaf-decomposing fungal communities in streams.

Cell division must be  coordinated to overall cell growth; otherwise, cells could become  arbitrarily large or vanishingly small. By observing how cells  respond to perturbations of the division cycle, cell biologists  discovered that the DNA-to-protein ratio plays an essential role in  determining the timing of mitosis and cell division. Recently,  molecular studies have revealed four classes of proteins that  participate prominently in the division control mechanism.

The long range  goal of this research is to develop mathematical models of the cell  division cycle in order to build secure, reliable connections  between hard-won molecular details of the control mechanisms and  classical observations of the behavior of the intact regulatory  system. The model will describe the regulation of MPF activity by  phosphorylation, and how the phosphorylation state of MPF is  determined by the DNA-to-protein ratio of the cell.

Conservation  form of the system is widely held as imperative for consistent  numerical capturing of shocks. In practice, while this may be  true for flows dominated by strong shocks, other flow phenomena  may be better modelled by different, not necessarily conservative  flow descriptions. In such cases, one may be prepared to  sacrifice strict conservation in favor of a nonstrictly  conservative model that describes better the dominant flow  features. To be reliable, the model should generate acceptably  small conservation errors. The investigator shows that  propagating fronts is one such phenomenon. Capturing propagating  fronts by conservative models gives rise to oscillations and  other inaccuracies near material fronts, and is in general  unsatisfactory. These are not the common oscillations associated  with high order schemes, but rather a result of the simple wave  model (i.e. eigenstructure) of the conservative systems. A remedy  is to use a nonconservative flow description, which offers a  different eigenstructure. It becomes exact near contact surfaces  and produces clean oscillation-free interfaces. Near shocks, the  model is not exact and conservation errors are committed. A  technique recently developed by the investigator offers a cure to  this problem. It uses viscous perturbations that render the  algorithm conservative to the order of numerical approximation  and generate acceptably small conservation errors. The technique  has been successfully applied to computing propagating fronts in  1D. The investigator will study several theoretical aspects of  this nonstrictly conservative algorithm and its application to  the computation of bubble dynamics in several space dimensions.  The work of the project involves theoretical analysis and  computer simulation of flows. These arise in physical phenomena  involving mixing of fluids, the initiation and evolution of  vortices, the ignition and evolution of chemical reactions in  fluids, and the propagation of flames. The aim of the project is  to develop analytical and computational tools to enhance the  understanding of the complicated physical phenomena involved.  Insight gained this way will supplement experimental data, which  are often expensive, difficult or even dangerous to obtain.

Algebraic K-theory and work on classifying spaces of finite groups  are good examples of this. Professor Kuhn has long been interested  in such overlaps, most recently in his work relating Steenrod  algebra technology to group representation theory. Here he will  study various topics in this spirit. One project consists of using  his representation theoretic tools to study some very classical  types of topological realization questions. Another consists of  using these same tools to study state-of-the-art questions in  algebraic K-theory. A third involves applying algebraic K-  theoretic methods to the group ring isomorphism problem.  The details of these three parts vary, but all are concerned  either with reducing geometric information to a subject for  calculation or to perfecting one of the principal algebraic tools  used for this purpose. The nature of the geometric information  involved is the crux of the difficulty. While questions about  lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth virtually cry out to  be reduced to calculations, it is far different with what are known  as topological properties of geometric objects. These are  properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece),  knottedness, having no holes, and so forth. All systematic study  of such properties, for example, how to tell whether two geometric  objects really differ in respect to one of these properties or are  only superficially different, or how to classify the variety of  differences that can occur, all these have only truly been  comprehended and mastered when they have been reduced to matters of  calculation.

Callose synthase activity is  ubiquitous in isolated membrane fractions from a wide variety of  plants, and has been hypothesized to be a deregulated form of  cellulose synthase. Therefore, to understand the biochemical basis  for the regulation of cell wall polysaccharide biogenesis and wound  healing, it is necesary to identify and characterize the  polypeptide subunits of polysaccharide synthases such as calloses  synthase, and the genes which encode them.  Although callose synthase has proven to be a stubborn enzyme to  purify to homogeneity by standard protein fractionation techniques,  rapid progress has been made towards identifying the polypeptide  components of callose synthases from various sources. Comparisons  of polypeptide profiles between our system, Beta vulgaris L., and  other plants show the emergence of common polypeptide profiles.  During the previous two years, through photoaffinity labeling,  improved enrichment procedures and most recently polypeptide  depletion, we have identified UDP-Glc-binding subunits of 57-,31-  and 29-kD, as well as a group of instrinsic hydrophobic  polypeptides of 92, 83, 43 and 27 kD. Our working hypothesis, upon  which the proposed experiments are predicated, is that the one or  more of these polypeptidesare part of a multi-subunit callose  synthase complex.  This project will proceed along two lines. The first will be a  continuation of our efforts to unambiguously identify callose  synthase subunits, and will consist of polypeptide-depletion  experiments, topographic analysis using vesicles of defined  sidedness, photolabeling studies using azido-probes and limited  proteolysis. We will continue to raise antibodies against  individual enzyme subunits. Second, we plan to clone and sequence  a structural gene(s) encoding subunit shown to be required for  enzyme activity.  Identification and cloning of callose synthase subunits should pave  the way for resolving the longstanding question of whether (1,3)  and (1,4) B-linked glucans are biosynthesized by a single enzyme or  distinct enzymes where each produces a distinct linkage type. The  availability of amino acid sequences and cDNA for callose synthase  subunits will reveal whether sequence homologies exist with known  bacterial cellulose synthase genes, and therefore define the extent  to which callose and cellulose synthases are structurally related.  This research will also help pave the way to study gene expression  during cell wall biogenesis.  %%%  Cellulose (1,4-B-D-glucan) is the world's most abundant  macromolecule, with an estimated 1011 tons biosynthesized per year.  It is a major component of plant cell walls providing structural  integrity and protection against invading plant pathogens.  Callose, the (1,3)-B-linked counterpart of cellulose, is  physiologically important since its synthesis is induced in  response to wounding and infection. Callose is also found in plant  structures such as pollen tubes, sieve plants and in the cell walls  of some monocots. B-glucans from plants and yeast are are  economically important due to their unique agrilcultural,  physiological and nutritional properties. Recent studies show that  B-Glucans of mixed linkage ((1,3),(1,4)-B-glucan) from oats and  (1,3)-B-glucan from yeast have the ability to lower cholesterol in  hypercholesteremic individuals when significant levels are  incorporated into the diet. The pharmaceutical industry is  interested in fungal glucan synthases because they represent  potential molecular targets for new drugs which are needed to treat  systemic fungal infections.  Very little is known about the biochemical mechanism by which  glucans are produced. This project focuses on expanding our  knowledge of the structure and function of (1,3)-B-glucan synthase,  commonly known as callose synthase, a cell wall biosynthetic enzyme  complex ubiquitous in higher plants. In the near-term, one  objective is continued application of basic protein chemistry to  make further progress towards the unambiguous identification of the  protein components of CS. In addition, our knowledge of the CS  complex has reached the point where a molecular biology component  is warranted. Thus, a second objective is to clone selected  components of the CS complex in order to obtain deduced amino acid  sequences for CS polypeptides. We will then determine whether  similarities exist with known sequences of cellulose synthase from  cellulose-producing microorganisms. This would indicate whether  cellulose and CSs are structurally related. This research will  also help to gain an improved understanding of callose deposition  as part of the wound response.  Research on the biosynthesis of plant-derived biopolymers has  important scientific and economic implications.

They are also significantly different in terms of  energetic electron precipitation in the upper atmosphere. The  suggestion has been made that PSC formation is stimulated by  electron participation by creating bremsstrahlung X rays that  penetrate to the stratosphere and ionize atmospheric constituents  there which become nucleation centers for droplet formation. If  correct, this would partially explain why ozone depletion and PSC  formation occur almost exclusively in Antarctica: energetic  electron precipitation is a common phenomenon there, but rarely  occurs in the Arctic polar cap. An experiment to investigate this  suggestion is to be conducted. A balloon payload with a strong,  localized ionization source will be flown through the cold Arctic  stratosphere; a photographic record would reveal whether the  ionization had caused droplet formation to occur.

This study  will examine some basic issues of cortical development: intrinsic  and extrinsic factors regulating either differentiation of neurons  or connectivity allowing the development of functionally distinct  areas of cerebral cortex in mammals. In particular, this proposal  will be focusing on the development of one part of the limbic  system, the perirhinal cortex. In recent transplantation studies,  results have shown there is an early specification of neurons to  express a limbic molecular phenotype, the limbic-system-associated  membrane protein, LAMP (Barbe and Levitt, 1991; Appendix I).  Earlier experiments showed that this molecule may play a role in  circuit formation in vitro (Keller et al., 1989). Most recently,  results suggested that there is a correlation between the early  commitment of the cortex to this molecular phenotype and the  formation of specific thalamocortical connections (Barbe and  Levitt, submitted; Appendix II). These experiments have led to  additional issues for exploration of cortical commitment and  connectivity. Using a tissue transplantation paradigm, I will be  testing two aspects of the development of the cortex into  functional areal arrays: 1) The commitment of cortical neurons to  a functional areal phenotype is linked to the cell cycle. 2) The  connections induced between limbic thalamic afferents and LAMP-  positive cortical transplants are maintained permanently.

He will assemble ceramics  from the site of Tiwanaku and immediate surrounding environs in  Bolivia. All were collected during careful archaeological  excavation and thus derive from known cultural contexts. He will  then conduct lipid analysis in an attempt to determine the foods  and other organic materials which were either stored, cooked or  consumed in these vessels. To do this he will also acquire modern  samples and ethnographic information from local inhabitants and  markets to provide a controlled baseline. With such data it  should be possible to answer a number of important questions  about the subsistence practices and social organization of  Tiwanaku's inhabitants.   Tiwanaku is a major monumental architectural site, occupying an  area of approximately 8 square kilometers.

Secondly,  it will help to elucidate the role which trade played in the rise  of this early Empire.

This research  will investigate the consequences of this functional hemispheric  asymmetry for information processing in neurologically normal  individuals. The research will do so by investigating the manner  in which the two hemispheres make complementary contributions to  perception, cognition, and action. One set of studies will  increase our understanding of the nature of left-hemisphere  dominance for a variety of linguistic processes as well as the  consequences of this hemispheric asymmetry for the strategies  typically utilized by neurologically normal individuals. A second  set of studies will investigate in a number of different ways the  hypothesis that the two hemispheres are predisposed toward the  efficient use of different types of visual information, i. e., that  the right hemisphere makes most efficient use of global or holistic  aspects of visual patterns whereas the left hemisphere makes most  efficient use of local or more fine-grained detail. A third set of  studies will investigate the ways in which the brain encodes  information about spatial dimensions such as left versus right. A  fourth set of studies will deal with the question of how it is that  unity of thought and action emerges from a brain consisting of two  hemispheres that differ in so many ways. These studies will  determine the variety of ways in which the two hemispheres interact  with each other. Of particular importance are studies that will  determine when and how the style of processing characteristic of  one hemisphere or the other comes to dominate performance.

Questions regarding both  individual and aggregate household behavior within newly-  established rural markets will be addressed through the analysis  of data gathered in a multi-purpose household-level survey that  will be modeled after the World Bank's Living Standard  Measurement Study (LSMS) survey. This household-level survey,  which will be undertaken in the provinces of Hebel and Liaoning,  will be carried out in the Spring of 1993, and will extend to  between 1200-1500 households in 24 villages.   This project will contribute to our understanding of the  complexities involved in economic institutional change through  providing a case study of household decision-making amidst  China's recent rural economic reforms. Intended contributions  are several: First, the project will help to identify those  factors at the local level in China that are presently impeding  an expansion in the role of product and factor markets in  resource allocation, and provide estimates of the resulting  inefficiency. Second, with elasticities obtained from the  construction of an agricultural household model, the implications  of alternative price and tax policies in the agricultural sector  can be investigated, and better policies formulated. Third,  drawing on the household and village level data, estimates of the  degree of inequality both in consumption and income at the local  level can obtained, and sources of the inequality diagnosed. And  fourth, drawing on time-series data dating back to the Land  Reform, the implications of alternative policies for  agriculture's long-term development will be investigated.

The results of this \"radio  probing\" will be compared with other ground-based coronal  observations and with in-situ observations from space-craft. The  basic objectives are to understand the mechanism(s) of coronal  heating and of solar wind acceleration, and the relationship  between large scale photospheric structures and large scale solar  wind structures. Ultimately, such understanding is necessary to  understand the coupling between the sun and the earth, enabling us  to understand and even to predict conditions in the space  environment around the earth.  The radio-remote-sensing observations detect the results of  phase modulation of radio waves passing through the solar wind in  various ways. This phase modulation is linearly proportional to  the electron density. Thus one observed the effects of electron  density fluctuations. The simplest observation is to measure the  solar wind velocity. However, the velocity is not the only  information one can derive. One can also estimate the spatial  spectrum of these density fluctuations and how they are couples to  velocity fluctuations. One can see the effects of plasma waves in  these observations and test their consistency with theoretical wave  spectra. One could use these methods to provide ground-based  support for the ULYSSES polar-orbiting space-craft.

They  will carry out a systematic study of the interaction of grain  boundary fluids and fluid inclusions during the progressive  deformation of quartz-dominated rocks and veins from the  Simplon Fault Zone (SFZ) in southwestern Switzerland and  northern Italy. Their research objective requires an  interdisciplinary approach which is well served by their  complementary expertise in structural geology (Mancktelow) and  metamorphic petrology (Johnson.) The SFZ is an ideal natural  laboratory for the proposed research since it contains an  unusually wide range of rock deformation types that have  already been quantitatively studied by Mancktelow.   The use of fluid inclusion data from naturally deformed rocks  is complicated by the unknown effects of deformation on the  compositions and densities of fluid inclusions. During  deformation, the modification, genesis, and annihilation of  fluid inclusions is intimately tied to the formation and  migration of grain boundaries and the distribution,  composition and physical properties of the grain boundary  fluid(s).

This  research investigates task-level planning for autonomous agents,  such as mobile robots, that function in an uncertain environment.  These robots typically have very approximate, inaccurate, or  minimal models ofthe environment. For example, although the  geometry of its environment is crucial to determining its  performance, a mobile robot might only have a partial, or local  \"map\" of the world. The research will investigate an approach  whereby the robot attempts to acquire the necessary information  about the world by planning a series of experiments using the  robot's sensors and actuators, and building data structures based  on the robot's observations of these experiments. A key feature of  this approach is that the experiments the robot performs should be  driven by the information demands of the task. This research  develops (1) a theory of sensor interpretation and task-directed  planning using perceptual equivalence classes, intended to be  applicable in highly uncertain or unmodelled environments, such as  for a mobile robot; (2) algorithmic techniques for modeling  geometric constraints on recognizability, and the building of  internal representations (such as maps) using these constraints;  (3) explicit encoding of the information requirements of a task  using a lattice (information hierarchy) of recognizable sets, which  allows the robot to perform experiments to recognize a situation or  a landmark; and (4) synthesis of robust mobot programs using the  geometric constraints, constructive recognizability experiments,  and uncertainty models imposed by the task.

We employ an innovative and efficient  research strategy whereby continuous, multivariable log data are  calibrated using \"ground-truth\" sediment lithological information  obtained from cores. Site 798 was the Leg 128 target for a  complete late Neogene paleoceanographic \"reference\" section for  this climatically-important region; however, sporatic core  recovery precludes a solely core-based reconstruction of these  records below ca. 1 Myr.  We describe separate core-based and log-based lines of  research whose products will be merged to reconstruct sediment  component percentage and flux records for the last 3 Myr.

These  and other statistical techniques are used to quantitatively  relate specific electrical, chemical, and physical log responses  to the measured core lithological variations.

First, the production of altered membrane  proteins is commonly toxic to cells, perhaps due to abnormal  interaction with the membrane itself or the membrane insertion  apparatus. Isolating mutants reducing this toxicity will help  identify its source. Second, altered membrane proteins are often  rapidly degraded by cellular proteases; Mutant screens can identify  the protease or proteases responsible for this instability.  %%%  Cells are surrounded by membranes which protect them from the  outside environment while allowing inward passage of nutrients.  Membranes are composed mainly of a combination of lipid and protein  molecules. The research proposed investigates the mechanisms used  by cells to assemble membranes by examining how proteins are  inserted into them in the appropriate functional structures. The  research will analyze mutant forms of one particular membrane  protein (lactose permease of the bacterium Escherichia coli) which  should show aberrant insertion. The patterns of altered insertion  should provide insights into the normal membrane assembly process.",a9205572,Genetic Analysis of Complex Membrane Protein Insertion,"August 1, 1992",$270000 (Estimated),Marcia Steinberg  MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"January 31, 1996 (Estimated)",Colin C.

The objective of this project is the design of behavioral control  techniques for a simulated network of army ant robotic devices.  The devices envisioned are small, inexpensive, and identical  mobile platforms which cannot transport material individually,  but can cooperate to lift and carry arbitrarily large objects.  The behavioral control approach seeks to minimize the complexity  of the units and the communications necessary by designing their  collective function into their group behavior rather than through  individual performance. Each \"ant\" will be programmed to respond  to sensory stimulus with simple reactions. The collective effect  of many such reactions will be the desired maneuvering task, in  much the dame way teams of humans can transport heavy objects  with minimal communications. Sensory inputs necessary will  include applied forces and the attitude of the load being  carried. The set of behavioral reactions designed will be  implemented in a computer simulation. The simulation will also  model the dynamics of the load, the force and attitude sensors,  \"beacon\" signals emitted by the units, and the possibility of  uneven or rough terrain. The speed, stability and accuracy of  the material transport system will be evaluated in order to  further develop the controls and to suggest behavioral approaches  to broader army-ant problems, such as team-forming,  reorganization, navigation, and message-passing.

Most of these fossils are poorly  preserved and incomplete, which makes it difficult for  paleontologists to interpret the early history of terrestrial  vertebrates. Much has been learned from study of the  currently-available fossils, and more can still be learned from the  few available examples. However, further progress in understanding  the earliest history of land-living vertebrates will come primarily  from the discovery of new fossils.  In 1985, a new locality containing numerous fossils of early  land vertebrates was discovered in southeastern Iowa near the town  of Delta. The Delta site has been dated by geologists at about 340  million years old, which makes it the oldest early-land-animal  locality in the United States, and one of the oldest in the world.  Over a periods of three years, more than 600 specimens including  about 50 partial skeletons, some nearly complete, were collected;  most of this collection is stored in the Field Museum of Natural  History, and some at the University of Iowa. The fossils are  well-preserved and the collection represents the largest number of  good specimens of any early-land-vertebrate locality.

Information conveyed by a neuron is encoded in the rate  and pattern of action potentials, or \"spikes\" transmitted along its  axon. While one neuron's average rate of firing has clear effects  on the firing of other neurons that it contacts through chemical  connections called synapses, there is little experimental evidence  as to what details of firing pattern may be transmitted from one  neuron to another, especially for synapses that have small  individual effects. That evidence will be provided by the research  to be done under this award to Drs. Timothy Cope and Brian Clark.

In addition, this work will yield  important new information on how multiple sensory neurons interact  when their firing becomes partially synchronized, a situation that  appears to typify the action of stretch-sensitive sensory neurons  during dynamic changes of muscular length. The results of this  research will be significant in two ways: first, it will reveal  what features of the spike trains of sensory neurons are actually  important for the control of muscles and movements; and second, it  will detail the influence between neurons that have a relatively  weak synaptic connection, thus shedding light on the mode of  information transfer across synapses.

While limited work has been done in this area, the region is  known to be rich in archeological remains including large numbers  of barrows or burial chambers. In a first season of survey and  excavation Dr. Earle located a number of additional sites which  are settlement or living areas. During the next two seasons a  number of these will be excavated. He and his team will first  conduct a reconnaissance survey of 2 square kilometers in two  parishes and undertake intensive line walks over 5 square  kilometers to locate more sites. Surface materials will be  collected and the upper \"plowzone\" level of the soil will be  sampled. More intensive excavation will be conducted at 15 sites  distributed across the Neolithic and Bronze age periods. On this  basis it should be possible to determine how complex societies  developed in this region.   Following the development of agriculture and pastoralism in many  parts of the world, one can trace changes in social organization  which lead, ultimately, to the rise of states. Early in this  process, chiefdoms arose and anthropologists still do not  understand the mechanisms through which this happened. Some argue  that population growth permitted by a more stable subsistence  base provided the driving force while others point to other  factors such as the development of long distance trade. Over the  course of the Bronze and Iron Ages in Scandinavia, chiefdoms  underwent cycles of rise and decline. The data collected from  this area will allow comparison with cases from other parts of  the world. From this it should be possible to separate historical  particulars from the more basic underlying mechanisms.   This research is important for several reasons.

To the extent that the waxing and waning of  Neoproterozoic ice sheets must have influenced sea level, we infer  that at least some of the most persistent sequence boundaries are  of global extent. This possibility needs to tested against the  emerging stratigraphic record in key sections. The Adelaide  geosyncline was selected as a reference section for sequence  stratigraphic research on the basis of its great thickness (15 km),  quality of outcrop, limited deformation and metamorphism,  availability of seismic and core data in adjacent basins of the  same age, varied biota (including acritarchs, trace fossils,  Ediacara assemblage metazoa, and stromatolites), and amenability to  stable isotope geochemistry.

Both of these  more classical objects have proved remarkably useful in obtaining  geometric/topological information about 3-manifolds from  homotopy-theoretic data, and the essential lamination has already  begun to show itself to be a worthy successor to both of its  `parents.' The investigator intends to use essential laminations  to study the extent to which the fundamental group of a 3-manifold  determines the manifold up to homeomorphism, and also to study the  question of whether or not the manifold admits a hyperbolic  structure. He further intends to use the existence of normal forms  for essential laminations to study the question of whether or not  a 3-manifold (principally a hyperbolic 3-manifold) contains an  essential lamination.  It is a surprising fact that although we live in a three  dimensional space, a so-called 3-manifold, and so are blessed with  a natural intuition about such geometric objects, in the end this  does not carry us as far as we might have expected, for questions  which have been settled by algebraic calculations for higher  dimensional manifolds still remain baffling in the 3-dimensional  case.

The starting point of the work rests with the 1870 result of G.  Cantor who showed that at most one trigonometric series can  converge to a given function. This is a different question from  that of determining whether a given series converges. It falls  into the category of what is known as a uniqueness question. A  longstanding problem has been the uniqueness question for  multiple trigonometric series. There are many more obstacles to  this question arising from the multiple methods of summation  available, which do not show up in the one variable case. The  investigators have determined that the uniqueness is valid in the  case of rectangular summation. Work will now be done in carrying  over newly developed techniques to investigate other summation  methods such as iterated or spherical convergence. In addition,  further studies will be carried out on questions of multiple  uniqueness and the problem of determining when a trigonometric  series (in several variables) is a Fourier series.  Trigonometric series form the backbone of the modern theory  of harmonic analysis. They play a ubiquitous role in the study  of analytic problems ranging from pure number theory to the  solution of partial differential equations of physics. Recent  results on the uniqueness question has opened up a new avenue of  research possibilities which have essentially been dormant for  decades.",a9204325,Mathematical Sciences: RUI Uniqueness of Multiple Trigonometric Series and Symmetric Analysis,"July 1, 1992",$50000 (Estimated),John V.

The focus of the study is on the  time-varying multipath data channel. At relatively low data rates,  the time-varying nature of wireless communication channels often  leads to channel variation over a small number of symbol intervals.  In this case a significant amount of training data can be embedded  in the transmitted packets of data to enable adjustments to be made  at the receiver. An alternative, perhaps forced by the need for  higher data rates, is to increase the bandwidth of the transmitted  signal. Then the relative rate of channel variation is less  compared to the symbol rate, and the fraction of training is  reduced.

Current research is directed towards  understanding the stochastic behavior of matching functionals.  This involves finding tight non-asymptotic bounds, limiting  distributions, and exponential type moment bounds. This would  add to the understanding of several combinatorial optimization  problems as well as empirical discrepancy problems, notably  finding the rate of convergence of the empirical to the true  distribution. Results of this type are useful in stochastic  bin-packing as well as statistical physics. Concerning  discrepancy problems in mathematical statistics, research is also  directed towards further enlarging the collection of known  Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) classes of sets. This involves  establishing general connections between VC classes of positivity  sets, quantifier elimination theorems, and semi-algebraic  geometry.  The proposed research will focus heavily on the theoretical  and mathematical aspects of the well-known transportation problem  as well as some of its generalizations. This problem has  received wide attention over the years and it is recognized that  a full understanding of its mathematical complexities will lead  to more efficient and perhaps simpler ways to solve optimization  problems ranging from the shipping of goods, to the routing of  airplanes and the study of statistical mechanics. In its simplest  and most elementary form the problem may be stated as follows.  Suppose that one is given n oil wells and n refineries and wishes  to efficiently pair off wells and refineries, so as to minimize  the sum of the matching distances. It is easy to see that there  are n| different possible matchings.

Dying neurons are  characterized by cell swelling and morphologically resemble a  commonly observed pattern of death termed necrosis. Because in C.  elegans cell death mechanisms can be dissected using genetic  approaches characterization of this necrotic like death should  provide novel insight into this death process. Mec-4 and deg-1 are  members of a gene family that appear to encode membrane proteins.  These genes (called degenerin genes) mutate in the same way to  induce death. mec-4 and deg-1 DNA sequences appear to cross  hybridize to DNAs from a number of species, raising the  possibility that members of gene degenerin families in other  organisms might also be capable of mutation to forms that induce  death.

The long-term goal of this research program is to  understand the structure and function of the Photosystem I reaction  center. In this project biochemical resolution and reconstitution  are combined with site-directed mutagenesis and protein  overproduction in E.coli to produce reaction centers with altered  spectroscopic and electron transport properties. Building upon our  most recent results and the tools developed and mutants constructed  in the current funding period, the following long-term goals will  be addressed:  1. The roles of FA AND/OR FB in the room-temperature photoreduction  of ferredoxin (or flavodoxin) and NADP+ via FNR.  2. Biochemical characterization of the two forms of FNR identified  in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002.  3. Characterization of the remaining genes encoding PS I  polypeptides in Synechococcus sp.

The nature of the PsaE- and NdhF-dependent paths of electron  transport in P700+ re-reduction.  %%%  All life on Earth ultimately depends on solar light energy capture  during photosynthesis, a process which leads to the reduction and  fixation of carbon dioxide and the evolution of oxygen gas as a by-  product. Light energy capture and transduction takes place in  multiprotein complexes known as reaction centers, which utilize the  light energy to initiate oxidation-reduction reactions and electron  transfer events which result in the production of chemical energy  (in the form of ATP) and chemical reductant (in the form of NADPH).  In oxygenic photosynthesis--the type which occurs in green plants,  algae, and bacteria known as cyanobacteria--the cooperation of two  reaction centers, denoted Photosystems I and II, are required. The  long-term goal of the research here proposed is to understand the  structural organization of the Photosystem I reaction center and to  unravel specific details of the electron transfer events that lead  to charge separation, charge stabilization, and electron transfer  to soluable carriers in this reaction center.

Abstract The State/Industry University Cooperative Research Center on Rock Mechanics (RMMC) was established in 1992 with matching funds from the NSF, the State of Oklahoma and a consortium of 14 oil and gas producing companies. The Center's objectives are to apply and integrate advanced geoscience and engineering concepts to issues related to the oil and gas industries. The Center's research program addresses both short and long term goals to solve the geological problems associated with unstable rock formations that cause collapse of boreholes, reservoir compaction and subsidence. The information generated in the Center's research will be used to develop improved drilling technologies in geologically difficult and unstable oil and gas fields. The State of Oklahoma through Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and Technology (OCAST) assists RMMC in developing technical cooperation to solve the problems of small businesses in the State.

In particular, work will be done on  boundary value problems for two different linear partial  differential operators on closed domains in the plane. The first  is the Tricomi equation for transonic fluid flow and the second  is a model equation for electromagnetic wave propagation in  axisymmetric cold plasmas. The primary objective of the work is  to characterize well-posed problems for singular solutions with  data prescribed on the entire boundary by studying the location  and strength of possible singularities to these problems. The  methods to be employed are a mixture of modern microlocal  analysis with classic objects such as special functions.  Explicit solution operators will be employed to obtain precise  information on the location and strength of the resulting  singularities. The explicit methods used in these models should  result in a more general understanding of mixed type problems and  provide a foundation for the study of nonlinear boundary value  problems of mixed type. In addition, the precise description of  the singularities in these models is of scientific interest  because their presence has physically reasonable interpretations.  In the fluid models, singularities correspond to the possible  presence of shock waves in transonic regimes, and in the plasma  models, singularities are related to possible plasma heating due  to energy absorption from the electromagnetic wave propagation.  Partial differential equations form the backbone of  mathematical modeling in the physical sciences. Phenomena which  involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials  and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are  expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships  between partial derivatives.

The focus is on the regulation of cyclization enzymes that catalyze  the first committed step of the pathway leading to a  physiologically active diterpenoid metabolite(s), and thus is a  logical site for regulation. One target enzyme is casbene  synthetase, which catalyzes the synthesis of the putative  phytoalexin, casbene, in castor bean seedlings. The casbene  synthetase gene is transcriptionally activated in response to  treatment of the seedlings with pectic fragment elicitors. Genomic  clones containing casbene synthetase coding sequences have been  isolated. A major goal of the research is to characterize the  casbene synthetase gene and the cis- and trans-acting factors that  participate in the transcriptional activation of the gene in  response to pectic fragment elicitors. These investigations are  of importance in connection with plant disease resistance since  phytoalexins are among the defensive components that appear in a  resistance response. Another experimental target is kaurene  synthetase, a key regulatory enzyme in the pathway leading to the  gibberellin family of regulators that help mediate environmental  influences on plant growth and development. A major objective is  to purify kaurene synthetase to homogeneity, and to use the  purified protein to prepare specific antibodies and kaurene  synthetase cDNA probes. These probes will be used to measure  kaurene synthetase mRNA levels in plant tissues, and changes in  their levels under different environmental conditions, as an  indicator of their relative potentials for gibberellin  biosynthesis.",a9204118,Regulation of Diterpene Biosynthesis in Higher Plants,"July 1, 1992",$168605 (Estimated),Machi F.

Most arguments about the evolution of  dispersal patterns assume that there is significant genetic  variation for these traits and that they covary genetically with  other traits influenced by natural selection. A major difficulty  in understanding the evolution of dispersal patterns has been the  inability to quantify individual differences in those biological  parameters contributing to dispersal potential. In the marine  slipper snail, Crepidula fornicata, the principal biological trait  governing dispersal capacity is the duration of a free-swimming  larval stage. Larval of Crepidula must develop in the plankton for  one to several weeks before becoming capable of metamorphosing to  the sedentary juvenile stage. This period of obligatory dispersal  can now be quantified for individual larvae. The study will  determine the quantitative genetic covariance with other larval and  post-metamorphic traits that have been previously proposed to  influence the development of metamorphic competence and fitness  variation, and will specifically test the hypothesis that dispersal  capacity may evolve through its genetic correlation with other  traits that are subject to natural selection.

The technique of non-linear mode-  locking can be used to generate femtosecond-duration  pulses from a titanium-doped sapphire laser. The  major limitation on the minimum pulse width  obtainable from this laser is optical dispersion inside  the laser cavity; i.e. different wavelengths of light take  a varying time to complete a round-trip through the  cavity of the laser. Since an ultrashort laser pulse  must have a wide spectral width, a short pulse will  not stay short if there is substantial dispersion in the  laser cavity. By doing detailed calculations of  dispersion, we have discovered a number of methods  for minimizing it in this laser. We have already  produced pulses of 25 femtoseconds duration-- a  record for ultrafast lasers. We plan to expand upon  this work to further advance the state-of-the-art in  ultrafast laser technology.

The  program is distinct from existing ones in that it allows rapid  evaluation of conformational and binding energies based entirely  on physical properties that can be mapped onto the molecular  surface. This in turn is represented using a fast surface  rendering algorithm, for display and manipulation by graphics  workstations. The underlying scientific component of this  project is based on the ability to calculate the conformational  and biding free energies of macromolecules by using a continuum  treatment of solvent.

Historical records indicate that  beaver probably inhabited most of the small streams in North  America prior to settlement by Europeans. The river flow on these  streams was likely impeded by a series of beaver dams, resulting  in ponds separated by the stream channels. Harvesting of beaver  led to their near extinction around 1900, but laws protecting them  have led to their rapid recovery. It is therefore important to  understand the influence of beaver on streams because their  presence characterizes the past and perhaps future status of  streams. The influence of beaver activity on phosphorus dynamics  in streams has not been fully studied. It is important that these  studies be done because phosphorus is an element which often  limits the growth and metabolism of aquatic organisms. If the  concentration of this element in water is changed by the presence  of beaver dams, then downstream reaches will be altered.

Plasma membrane  protein dynamics may also be involved in many other forms of whole  cell locomotion along solid substrates or extracellular matrix.  Contact of the flagellar membrane with a solid substrate is  hypothesized to initiate a transmembrane signaling pathway that  activates an intraflagellar motor responsible for binding to and  applying force to the flagellar membrane glycoproteins.  Crosslinking of certain populations of flagellar membrane  glycoproteins with anti-carbohydrate monoclonal antibodies is an  artificial means to initiate the signaling pathway (involving  calcium influx and changes in protein phosphorylation) and result  in redistribution of the flagellar membrane proteins recognized by  the antibodies. The present study is directed towards an  elucidation of the role of protein phosphorylation in the signaling  pathway and the identification and characterization of the  biological motor responsible for glycoproteins movements and hence  whole cell gliding motility. Studies will address the regulated  association of flagellar membrane proteins and protein kinases with  the 350 Kda flagellar membrane glycoproteins, and the association  of phosphoproteins and other proteins in the membrane-matrix  fraction with axonemal and brain microtubules. An in vitro system  for studying flagellar membrane dynamics using inside-out flagellar  membrane vesicles and purified microtubules will be developed.  Biological motor activity will be sought within the membrane-matrix  compartment using in vitro microtubule gliding assays. The 3S  calcium-specific ATPase in the membrane -matrix fraction will be  purified and characterized as a candidate motor. Monoclonal  antibodies to various flagellar membrane-matrix phosphoproteins and  to candidate motor proteins will be obtained for use as probes for  studying the role of these proteins in flagellar signaling and  force production for glycoprotein movement and whole cell  locomotion.  %%%  The unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas, is a widely used model  organism for studying a wide variety of biological questions. The  alga has flagellae, which enable it to swim freely in aqueous  media, in a manner which is functionally similar to other  flagellar-propelled motilities in other organisms. The  Chlamydomonas flagellum has therefore been a highly productive  model for studying the mechanism of flagellar motility in general.  In addition to the free-swimming mode of locomotion, Chlamydomonas  also exhibits a gliding motility on solid substrata, which also  involves the flagellum, or, more specifically, the plasma membrane  surrounding the flagellum. The mechanism of this gliding motility  has been traced to the active movement of certain membrane  glycoproteins within the plane of the flagellar membrane. It is  likely that this system will serve as a good general model for  studying \"deliberate\" movements of membrane proteins within the  plane of the membrane.",a9206535,Flagellar Glycoproein Dynamics and Whole Cell Locomotion,"September 1, 1992",$328999 (Estimated),Eve Ida Barak  MCB DIV OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIENCE BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"August 31, 1996 (Estimated)",Robert A.

It operates through  the generation of photocarriers in a high-  resistivity sample, followed by  photoconductive transport and trapping of  the charge at defects. The  photogenerated space-charge fields alter  the optical properties of the sample  through the electro-optic effect. The  photorefractive effect is one of the most  attractive optical nonlinearity for  applications of all-optical control and  image processing because it requires very  low light intensities. This low-light  requirement is a direct consequence of  the storage of space-charge on defects,  allowing low light intensities to be  integrated over time. Applications  include phase conjugation, optical  amplification and spatial light modulators.   Recent advances in the photorefractive  effect are using the electro-optic  properties of quantum-confined structures  ?Nolte, 1990!.

Preliminary results  show some unexpected relationships among tribes and subfamilies  that need to be assessed in terms of characters used: i.e.,  caesalpinioids Gleditsia and Ceratonia are a basal sister group to  the rest of the legumes; and Caesalpiniodeae appears non-  monophyletic. The research will also test the hypothesis that  specialized character states are first expressed late in floral  ontogeny, using species of Sophora, a papilionoid with diverse  pollinators. In addition, presumably different development  pathways leading to convergent floral structure will be documented  in three caesalpinioid genera (Cassia s. str., Chamaecrista, Senna)  that are strikingly alike in specialized character states.",a9207671,Ontogenetic Evidence for Phylogenetic Trends in Legumes (Fabaceae),"August 1, 1992",$155000 (Estimated),James E.

These two  gonadotropin hormones are composed of two subunits, a common  alpha-subunit and a beta-subunit which is unique and confers  specificity. Dr. Attardi has demonstrated that gonadotropin  releasing hormone, a hormone found in the hypothalamus of the  brain, and the gonadal hormones, inhibin, activin and follistatin,  cause rapid and profound effects on the synthesis of FSH but not  LH.

Moreover, ultrafast laser techniques  have been developed that now allow  the measurement of charge transport  over micron and nanometer dimensions  with picosecond and femtosecond  temporal resolution. The objective  of this proposal, simply stated, is  to take advantage of these advances  in materials growth and in ultrafast  laser spectroscopy to study,  measure, optimize and control charge  transport and space-charge field  formation in semiconductor  structures over nanometer spatial  dimensions. The intent is not only  to improve the transport, but  simultaneously to enhance the  magnitudes and speeds of the optical  nonlinearities that result from such  transport.  Future advances in the development  of photonic and electronic systems,  and interconnects between the two,  may well rely on, and be limited by,  the ability to measure and control  charge formation, screening and  changes in optical properties that  accompany such transport. Carrier  transport over these dimensions will  occur on sub-picosecond time scales  and may even be ballistic. Moreover,  even modest voltages applied across  such small dimensions will produce  huge fields and may result in hot  carriers. While much is known about  the relaxation of nonequilibrium  carriers in energy within the bands,  little is known about transport  under these conditions of the  effects of that transport on the  nonlinear optical response.  Since the idea is to engineer the  structure to improve the transport  and to enhance the optical  nonlinearities that result from such  transport, these studies will  require the growth, investigation  and optimization of several unique  and non-traditional structures and  materials for which growth  techniques have not been extensively  developed. Moreover, we will be  engaged in an active iterative  process in which the optical-based  transport information will be  correlated with structural  characterization and fed back into  the structural design and growth to  obtain material and structures with  improved transport and transport-  related optical properties.

These geometries are intimately interrelated, yet each  displays its own characteristic personality. Direct constructions  of discrete groups by fundamental polyhedra (in the spirit of  Poincare) in geometries in which totally geodesic hypersurfaces  either do not exist or are not sufficiently flexible to build  fundamental polyhedra, have led to alternate notions of half-spaces  and hypersurfaces. The investigator has analyzed how such  hypersurfaces intersect and the possible combinatorial types for  polyhedra built from these objects. He applies this theory to the  geometry and topology of moduli spaces of geometric structures on  a manifold, these spaces being closely related to the better known  moduli space of representations of a manifold's fundamental group,  a structure profitably studied using gauge-theoretic techniques.  The prototype of such moduli spaces is Teichmueller space, and one  objective of this project is to see how the geometry of  Teichmueller space extends to these more general moduli spaces.  Despite the fact that we live in a 3-dimensional manifold, our  intuition quickly fails us as a guide to the truth or falsity of  fairly simple questions about their general geometric and  topological properties. Nor is it terribly helpful in telling us  where to look for answers. An elaborate theory has been developed  which is growing by leaps and bounds and has been far more  successful than raw intuition, one of the most surprising features  of the theory being the prominent role that a non-Euclidean  geometry, so-called hyperbolic geometry, occupies in this theory.  Other special geometric structures also have been exploited in  similar ways, somewhat as a scaffolding is used in constructing a  building: One asks a topological question about a manifold,  something intrinsically independent of geometry. One then imposes  a geometric structure, deduces properties that seem to depend upon  this geometric structure (and some of which, as intermediate steps,  actually do depend upon it), and finally in a sense kicks away the  scaffolding to reveal the desired answer to the original question.  By this I mean that one observes that one has deduced a result that  does not mention the geometric structure explicitly, and that one  then succeeds in showing that any other choice for the geometric  structure would have led to the same final result. This is only  one intriguing aspect of such research, for it is true that the  geometric structures involved have now attracted a considerable  amount of interest in their own right.",a9205139,Mathematical Sciences: Geometric Structures and Discrete Groups,"September 1, 1992",$121700 (Estimated),Ralph M.

Three overlapping areas will be treated in the work.  The first concerns nonlinear partial differential equations of  evolution which are of mixed type in the space variable. Initial  work will focus on a concrete example, the Kompaneetz Equation of  plasma physics. It can be written as an abstract Cauchy problem.  The first task is to determine properties of the resolvent; in  particular whether or not it has a dense range. The second area  involves semigroups of operators, particularly those whose  infinitesimal generators split into a linear and locally smooth  nonlinear part. The object is to determine conditions for a  globally defined semigroup of operators determining the solution  for all time and to bound the difference of any two solutions as  a function of time and the initial function norms. Finally, work  will be done on spin polarization Thomas-Fermi theory involving a  minimizing problem for pairs of functions. One main obstacle to  finding extrema is the functional involving the two unknowns is  not convex. By topological arguments, one can show that extrema  exist. The next step will be to find a method which will produce  the minima in a concrete fashion.  The project combines abstract mathematical concepts with  models of various phenomena in the physical world.

The  increasing size and decreasing cost of semiconductor memory has  prompted research into databases which are memory resident.  These Main Memory DataBase (MMDB) systems are aimed at high  throughput applications such as airline reservation systems,  phone switching databases, and other real time systems where the  availability of the memory resident data is crucial. To achieve  this high availability with volatile RAM requires a backup  archive database on disk as well as efficient algorithms to  checkpoint the database to the archive and to recover it from the  archive to main memory after a system failure. It has been shown  that MMDB systems often perform better with deferred update  techniques where data to be updated is first placed in a special  nonvolatile shadow area and only at transaction commit time is  placed in main memory. The authors are investigating both  checkpointing and reloading of MMDB databases with the use of  more conventional immediate update (IU) techniques as well as  deferred update (DU) strategies. The best checkpointing  approaches are to be determined as are partial reloading  strategies. A partial reload allows the database to be brought  online after a system failure faster because not all of the MMDB  is reloaded prior to bringing the system up. This research  represents the first examination of techniques for partial  reloading of MMDB systems. Due to the volatility of RAM, the  high throughput needs of MMDB applications, and the potential for  partial reloading to dramatically increase the uptime of database  systems, the results and impact of this research are both  widespread and significant.",a9201596,Main Memory Database Recovery Issues,"September 15, 1992",$199000 (Estimated),Y.

Thus,  the study of fossilization processes of separate ossicles is  important for sedimentologists as well as for paleontologists.  In order to determine the effects of in-place degradation of  crinoid ossicles, the elements will be glued to plexiglass plates  and fastened to concrete hemispheres on the seafloor. Ossicles  will also be glued to plexiglass rods buried vertically in the  seafloor sediment to study the effects of burial.

The first class of problems is concerned with the  long-time behavior of solutions of nonlinear dispersive systems  in terms of a nonlinear bound state channel (modeling nondecaying  behavior) and a dispersive radiation field. The governing  equations have the structure of a finite dimensional dynamical  system which is coupled to the infinite dimensional dispersive  radiation field. In the second, a new theory for a class of  eigenvalue problems will be applied to nonlinear equations  modeling long wave propagation in dispersive media. An advanced  formulation is being developed which is independent of the  dynamical systems framework. Applications to nonlocal equations  arising in the study of fluids and plasmas will be sought. The  third goal is to study the existence and properties of nonlinear  bound states of the vector Zakharov and Schrodinger equations.

The gene is  identified by the tumorous phenotype of mitotic-recombination  clones that are homozygous for small chromosome deficiencies of the  wts gene. Absence of the wts gene from imaginal disc cells causes  excess cell proliferation, causes clone rounding presumably by  interfering with control of oriented cell divisions, and allows  cuticle to be secreted between cells as well as over their apical  surfaces.

Due to this  change in topology, in addition to the exponential growth the  Internet is currently experiencing, there exists a dire need for  new protocols that support both the ability to route traffic  based on policy (PB) and/or type of service (TOS) and the ability  to scale well with respect to the memory, computational, and  bandwidth resources necessary to provide for adaptive routing of  traffic. This proposal addresses these requirements by combining  the best of three current routing protocols. The Border Gateway  Protocol (BGP) was first implemented on the NSFNET backbone as a  direct response to the need for a new exterior gateway protocol  in the late 1980s to handle the increase in size of the Internet  and the non-hierarchical peering that was beginning to appear.  It is based on a path-vector routing model which uses static  routes with accompanying policies per network and is intended for  use with IP-based networks. It is currently being adapted and  implemented by major routing vendors in their products. The  Inter Domain Routing Protocol (IDRP) is BGP with additional  capabilities and adapted for use in the OSI world using CLNP.  IDRP is very close to passing its last international standards  vote and will then be an ISO/CCITT standard. Its emergence will  be very helpful in the deployment of U.S. GOSIP compliant  networks. The Inter Domain Policy Routing (IDPR) is a model  that allows for the pre-selection of the networks a packet will  transit based on the policies and TOS supported by the transit  networks in addition to the policies or TOS required by the  source. This capability is one that many Federal agencies need  in order to select network paths based on security, cost factors,  guaranteed bandwidth for multi-media and real time experimental  control, in addition to providing the agencies with the tools  necessary for implementing their acceptable use policies. The  IDPR uses dynamic installation of routes to accomplish its goals.  The combination of BGP, IDRP, and IDPR would provide the best of  all worlds. Economy of resources would be gained using the  aggregation features found in BGP/IDRP, thereby reducing routing  table sizes, reducing the computational cycles required to  calculate routes, and the bandwidth necessary for transmitting  the routing information. In addition, the flexibility found in  IDPR, required to handle special cases such as those defined by  the federal agencies, and both quality of service and type of  service support will be provided. This proposal aims at building  on the currently deployed infrastructure and protocols in a  manner that would not require a mass scale replacement of current  technologies and equipment, and therefore provide for a phased  evolution to an Internetwork with enhanced capabilities.",a9206418,A Unified Approach to Inter-Domain Multiple-Tos Routing,"September 1, 1992",$307537 (Estimated),Mark A.

It involves  the function-theoretic and geometric properties of bounded  pseudoconvex domains in n-dimensional complex space and their  automorphism groups. The first goal of the research is to  identify domains with noncompact automorphism groups by the local  geometry of their boundaries. Particular interest is placed on  boundaries which are not entirely smooth. The second component  of the work is the extension of studies on the asymptotic  behavior of the intrinsic invariant metrics defined on the  bounded pseudoconvex domains. The research relates the boundary  behavior of the automorphisms and the compactness of the  automorphism groups. Finally, work will be done identifying  the bounded symmetric domains by their boundary geometry  among domains with noncompact automorphism groups. The projects  are connected by the theme that the size of the automorphism  groups and the boundary geometry of bounded domains are tied  together.  The study of several complex variables arose at the  beginning of the century initially to examine those properties of  classical function theory which generalize to several variables.

Although major originations took place during this  time, almost half of known Late Triassic tetrapod families became  extinct by the Early Jurassic. The temporal, taxonomic and  geographic extent of this faunal turnover has been debated,  principally because well-dated, fossiliferous rock sequences are  rare. The Late Triassic Fleming Fjord Formation offers a greater  range of stratigraphic and lithologic exposures (representing  lacustrine, fluviatile and subaerial environments) than those in  which Late Triassic faunas have previously been found. The Fleming  Fjord fauna is now known to include a substantial representation of  European taxa, including prosauropod (Plateosaurus) and theropod  dinosaurs, a turtle (Proganochelys), an aetosaur (Aetosaurus  ferratus), a pterosaur (Eudimorphodon), plagiosaurid (Gerrothorax)  and capitosauroid (cf. Mastodonsaurus) amphibians, as well as other  taxa (a phytosaur, sharks, lungfish, and semionotids).

There is preliminary evidence  that this membrane domain may be involved in calcium regulation,  based on spectrofluorometric studies in cell cultures and single  cells. The complex is widespread in prokaryotes and may be present  in mitochondria of eukaryotes. It is hypothesized to act by  solvating polyanionic salts and forming ion-conducting complexes  which could result in the removal of calcium from the cell, with  simultaneous removal of phosphate. The voltage-dependent calcium  conductance of the complex from E. coli will be studied in planar  lipid bilayers.

For several years, the elongation and termination  properties of mammalian RNA polymerase II have been studies in this  laboratory. This research includes studies on these reactions with  yeast RNA polymerase II using in vivo and in vitro techniques. The  advantage to studying these processes in yeast (Saccharomyces  cerevisiae) is the availability of powerful genetic tools to  complement biochemical analyses. There are five specific  objectives: 1) Identify the signals which cause yeast RNA  polymerase II to terminate; 2) Define the physical structure of  specific elongation complexes; 3) Evaluate the contribution of the  conserved C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of the  polymerase to the elongation reaction; 4) Examine the mechanism by  which yeast transcript elongation factor SII promotes terminator  read through by RNA polymerase II; and 5) Identify other cellular  proteins involved in regulating transcript elongation in the cell.  The results from these experiments should provide fundamental  information about the regulation of transcript elongation in  eukaryotes. The similarities in components of the transcriptional  machinery between yeast and larger eukaryotes suggest that much of  the information obtained here will be directly related to  mechanisms in other eukaryotes. Any differences which we observe  obviously will also be important. The advantage to this approach  is that genetic tools are available to complement the biochemical  and cell biology approaches available in mammalian cells.  %%%  Transcriptional regulation is a major control point for gene  expression. This control can occur during initiation elongation or  termination. Controls during elongation and termination by  mammalian RNA polymerase II have been studied in this laboratory  for several years. While studies of the mechanisms controlling  transcript elongation and termination mammalian cells have provided  much preliminary information, there are limits to the types of  experiments that can be done in such systems. Thus, we propose to  expand our previous work with mammalian cells by studies of  transcription regulation in yeast. The advangatage to studying  these processes in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is the  availability of powerful genetic tools to complement biochemical  analyses. There are five specific objectives: (1) Identify the DNA  sequences are which yeast RNA polymerase II stops elongating an RNA  chain, These experiments will use both the intact cell in vivo as  well components isolated from those cell in vitro. (2) Define the  physical structure of specific elongation complexes containing the  polymerase, the DNA template, and the RNA transcript. Enzymatic  and chemical probes will be used to identify the molecular contacts  between the protein and nucleic acid components in these complexes.  (3) Evaluate the contribution of the C-terminal domain of the  largest subunit of the polymerase to the elongation reaction. This  subunit contains a unique structure consisting of multiple.  Repeated heptapeptide sequences. Quantitative analysis of the  elongation properties of polymerase molecules containing and  lacking this domain will be carried our (4) Examine the mechanism  by which a yeast transcript elongation factor (SI) stimulates  elongation by RNA polymerase II. The clone for the yeast SII  protein will be mutagenized, and activity of the mutant proteins  will be compared.

Elucidation of the mechanisms controlling r-  protein synthesis will greatly enhance our understanding of  eukaryotic ribosome formation and add to our knowledge of  eukaryotic translational control. The translational  regulation of r-protein synthesis is due to the interaction of  factors with structural motifs within the 5'untranslated region  of r-protein nRNAs. A major aim of this proposal is to  determine the secondary structure of the 5'end of purified L32  and S16 r-protein mRNAs and determine the structure of these  same mRNAs when they are assembled into 45S subpolysomal mRNP  or polysomes. This will be accomplished using chemical and  enzymic Probes specific to single or double stranded RNA and  crosslinking agents. If similar secondary structures are  detected in L32 and S16 r-protein mRNA, their importance for  translation will be evaluated by making compensating and  noncompensating changes in the stem sequence and then assaying  the effect of these changes on translation. Another major aim  is to identify and characterize the factors binding to the 5'  end of r-protein mRNAs as these may regulate the translation of  r-protein mRNA. It will be determined whether these factors  are different from factors binding to the 5' end of efficiently  translated mRNAs and determine whether their activity changes  during myoblast differentiation. This will be addressed using  gel mobility shift and UV crosslinking techniques. The last  major aim is to isolate and characterize the S16 45S sub  polysomal mRNP using centrifugation, gel electrophoresis and  biotin-strepavidin chromatography, and to determine the RNA and  protein composition of this subpolysomal mRNP Analysis of the  structure of this mRNP should determine if the 45S subpolysomal  mRNP is a storage particle or an intermediate in the  translation initiation pathway.  %%%  Ribosomes translate mRNA into protein and therefore play a  central role in cellular metabolism. The ribosome content of  eukaryotic cells is therefore highly controlled to insure that  cells have a sufficient number of ribosome to support growth  and development.

(The latter should help make the many significant applications of  this method accessible to a wider audience of set-theorists.) (1)  With his former student, Dorshka Wylie (now an NSF fellow and an  instructor at M.I.T.), he is engaged in a radically new approach to  the core model K for a strong cardinal, which should provide a  powerful new tool for establishing combinatorial principles in K.  (2) A second goal is to enable coding methods to lift smoothly to  K, permitting extension of results such as his proof of the Pi-1-2-  Singleton Conjecture to the core model context. (3) A long-  standing open question in the theory of iterated forcing concerns  the problem of extending the method of countable support iteration  beyond omega-2 without collapsing cardinals. A number of important  consistency problems could be solved by such a technique. With his  student, Dimitiros Tzimas, Friedman will attempt to develop such a  method through the use of morasses. (4) Friedman will also explore  questions in descriptive set theory as to whether the full  structure theory for projective sets can be developed directly from  the existence of large cardinals, without the use of infinite game  theory.  Set theory provides the popular way to lay the foundations for  all of mathematics, the best known systematic attempt to do this  being Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, dating from  the early part of the 20th Century. Important foundational  questions concern the independence and the consistency of the  axioms used to establish set theory. Zermelo and Fraenkel's axioms  (ZF for short) are one of the most convenient sets of basic axioms.  However, it has been known since the work of Kurt Goedel in the  1930's that no axioms for set theory can be complete as well as  consistent. This means that no set of axioms can be powerful  enough to prove every possible proposition or else its negation,  but not both. Upon this startling theorem has been erected a rich  theory, treating possible propositions P such that either P or Not  P can be added to ZF without resulting in a contradiction. Any  such proposition P is said to be independent of ZF and can be taken  as an additional axiom of set theory. The principal technique for  finding such independent propositions is Paul J. Cohen's so-called  method of forcing and its offspring.

The  major capsid protein of simian virus 40 (SV40) is synthesized in  the cytoplasm of infected cells and is transported to the nucleus  shortly after synthesis for viral assembly. The protein forms the  pentameric capsomeres of the SV40 capsid. Vp1 pentamers are  detectable both in the cytoplasm of infected cells and in vitro.  The nature of the interactions involved in Vp1 capsomere formation,  as well as the residues involved, are not known. Cytoplasmic Vp1  pentamer formation is not only the initial stage of SV40 assembly,  but may also have a role in the efficient nuclear transport of Vp1.  Here, we propose to examine the chemical nature and the amino acid  residues involved in Vp1 multimer formation in vitro. Results from  the proposed experiments will later be used to study the role of  pentamer formation in the transport of Vp1 to the nucleus.  %%%  Due to the relative simplicity of its gene structure, simian virus  40 has been used as a model system for studies of virus assembly,  structure, and function. The virus assembles in the nucleus of the  host cell, and thus it is also an ideal model system for study of  nuclear localization and nuclear localization signals.

In our research to-date,  chimeric genes consisting of a portion of the 5'-flanking region  of alpha2 and alpha3 subunit genes ligated to the coding region of  the firefly luciferase gene have been utilized to transiently  transfect neonatal cardiac myocytes. Surprisingly, we find that the  expression of both alpha2 and alpha3 chimeric genes is  significantly repressed by T3 in the presence of co-transfected T3  receptor. These observations are consistent with a preliminary  finding of T3-mediated repression of endogenous alpha2 and alpha3  subunit gene transcription.

This will be  achieved by using a multiple-scales averaging methodology and  studying the corresponding amplitude and phase modulation  equations. The effects of internal resonances between flexible  modes on the mode localization will be analytically investigated  and the force responses of the system due to external harmonic  loads will be considered. It will be shown that weakly coupled  cyclic assemblies possess fundamental, subharmonic and  superharmonic localized resonances, during which only a limited  number of their subsystems resonate. Motion confinement of  externally generated disturbances due to nonlinear mode  localization will then be investigated by numerical computations,  involving finite element and Gallerkin methodologies.

The  controllability of such systems is then greatly improved, since  in designing for passive or active vibration isolation, one needs  only consider the dynamics of a limited number of their  substructure instead of considering the response of the whole  cyclic assembly.*** //",a9207318,Nonlinear Periodic Systems with Mode Localization and Motion Confinement Characteristics,"September 1, 1992",$87701 (Estimated),Devendra P.

This stagnant growth covers an equally  unprecedented divergence in the trend of real wages between high  and low wage earners, which became apparent in the 1980's. The  more skilled and educated workers continued to experience  significant growth in real wages, while wages of the less  educated and skilled remained the same or even declined.  Consequently, as the average standard of living has barely  increased in almost two decades, wage and income inequality has  risen. Looking at this situation form the vantage point of the  labor market, two basic hypotheses emerge to explain this growing  income inequality. One is that the growth of information and new  technologies and the globalization of economic activity has led  to increased demand for a well educated and flexible work force.  The other is that there is a growing gap between desired labor  force quality and its actual supply, and that the quality of  worker performance may have actually deteriorated.   The purpose of this research is to analyze earnings inequality  from 1967 through 1990 using micro data from the Current  Population Survey in order to shed light on which hypotheses or  combination explains the increase in earnings inequality. Annual  changes in wage inequality of men will be studied by means of  human capital analysis. The exhaustive and computable factors in  this analysis are: (1) changes in levels and dispersion of human  capital across workers; (2) changes in rates of returns on human  capital investments; and (3) changes in dispersion of rates of  return. The analysis also distinguishes between effects of  schooling and of job market investments, as well as between  annual and life-time inequality. A more complete understanding  of the developments of and prospects for earnings inequality  requires the analyses of supply responses to changes in the wage  structure and in job market investment costs.

Statistical procedures suggested by  priors will also be examined using usual frequentist criteria  like consistency and asymptotic normality. Tests of the  assumptions for statistical models useful for policy analysis  will be considered and the performance of such models under  failure of these assumptions will evaluated.  The foundations of statistics include concepts of prior  beliefs and their characterization and their relation to good  statistical procedures. How standard statistical procedures  behave under nonstandard conditions and how to test the  conditions to verify assumptions are other basic issues to be  considered in this project.,a9208677,Mathematical Sciences: Chance Processes and the Foundation of Statistics,"July 15, 1992",$60000 (Estimated),Stephen M.

Students will have the unique opportunity to combine  compelling fieldwork with modern laboratory techniques. Student  training will be a three-fold process. First, lectures will be  given on the structure and function of the insect nervous system;  the hormonal regulation of insect metamorphosis and neural  development; the hormonal regulation of insect behavior; and  experimental design. Second, students will receive practical  training in the safe handling of colonies of honey bees and in  observation of honey bee behavior, and ample opportunity to  practice these new skills. Third, students will also receive  laboratory instruction in histological techniques for the light  microscopic study of the insect nervous system. Each student will  then carry out a research project in which an aspect of bee brain  morphology, cell number, neurochemistry, neurotransmitter  expression, gene expression, or hormonal responsiveness etc. is  studied in bees of known age and behavioral status. The goal of  this project is to introduce students who already have an interest  in neuroscience and behavioral biology to the value of social  insects as models for the study of the neurobiology of complex  behavior. This project represents and extension of an ongoing  collaboration between two laboratories in the Department of  Entomology and the Neuroscience Program at the University of  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It will be based in the Bee Research  Facility and two other well-equipped laboratories in the Department  of Entomology.",a9200326,Honey Bee Neurobiology and Behavior Program,"April 1, 1992",$30590 (Estimated),BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES  BIO DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"September 30, 1993 (Estimated)",Susan E.
